<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Decorating Eggs: Exquisite Designs With Wax &amp; Dye</h2><p>Shows how to decorate eggs with complex patterns using wax, and suggests traditional and modern patterns</p><p>Jane Pollak is one of the northeast&#x2019;s foremost coaches of entrepreneurial women and a living example of how to turn a passion into a thriving business. A successful entrepreneur, public speaker, author, and business coach, Jane launched her professional career in an unlikely field: egg decoration. Having earned a Masters from Columbia Teachers College, Jane taught high school early on in her career. What began as a class project became a passion for pysanky -- the Ukranian word for &#x201c;eggs which have been written on.&#x201d; Jane&#x2019;s artistic talents and keen attention to the smallest detail were ideally suited for this precise, highly creative art form. Even so, there were times when the challenges of part-time entrepreneurship and motherhood -- Jane was raising three children in suburban Connecticut -- required real tenacity and perseverance. Jane&#x2019;s story is an odyssey that led her from remote craft fairs and customer rejections to an invitation to the White House and appearances on NBC&#x2019;s Today Show. National publications featured Jane&#x2019;s artwork as early as 1985, when her patchwork quilt eggs were showcased in the magazine Country Living. Since then, her work has appeared in the New York Times and other prominent publications. Currently, Jane lives in New York City.Many people are familiar with the brightly colored Ukranian eggs that appear at Easter time, but decorating eggs can be a year-round craft. Many decorated eggs are fragile works of art that are saved for years and are highly prized by their owners. Pollak's projects are an eclectic selection of designs from many cultures, all applied to eggshells by using a wax-and-dye technique similar to batik. They are wonderfully varied and include cut eggshell jewelry as well as whole decorated eggs.<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>JOHN THE BALLADEER</h2><p>Silver John wanders North Carolina&#39;s mountains with his silver-strung guitar in a land and time where the supernatural--from George Washington&#39;s ghost to something evil dwelling in a deserted mine--is never far away</p><p></p><h2>The Friend of Madame Maigret (Inspector Maigret Mysteries)</h2><p>In <i>The Friend of Madame Maigret</i>, Simenon?s economic prose brilliantly portrays the Marais quarter of Paris and those who haunt its narrow streets as Inspector Maigret attempts to prove that a murder has actually been committed without a corpse anywhere to be found. As the investigation becomes increasingly complex, seemingly unconnected characters are drawn into the case, and Maigret begins to wonder if his wife?s earlier strange encounter with a woman and her baby may be the missing link.</p><p>Georges Simenon (1903&#x2013;1989) began work as a reporter for a local newspaper at the age of sixteen, and at nineteen he moved to Paris to embark on a career as a novelist. He went on to write seventy-five Maigret novels and twenty-eight Maigret short stories.Maigret ranks with Holmes and Poirot in the pantheon of fictional detective immortals.

A spectacularly good book about an incredibly painful and important topic."--<b>Sebastian Junger, author of </b><b><i>Tribe</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>War</i></b></b><br><br>Private First Class Bowe Bergdahl left his platoon's base in eastern Afghanistan in the early hours of June 30, 2009. Since that day, easy answers to the many questions surrounding his case--why did he leave his post? What kinds of efforts were made to recover him from the Taliban? And why, facing a court martial, did he plead guilty to the serious charges against him?--have proved elusive.<br><br>Taut in its pacing but sweeping in its scope, <i>American Cipher</i> is the riveting and deeply sourced account of the nearly decade-old Bergdahl quagmire--which, as journalists Matt Farwell and Michael Ames persuasively argue, is as illuminating an episode as we have as we seek the larger truths of how the United States lost its way in Afghanistan. The book tells the parallel stories of a young man's halting coming of age and a nation stalled in an unwinnable war, revealing the fallout that ensued when the two collided: a fumbling recovery effort that suppressed intelligence on Bergdahl's true location and bungled multiple opportunities to bring him back sooner; a homecoming that served to deepen the nation's already-vast political fissure; a trial that cast judgment on not only the defendant, but most everyone involved. The book's beating heart is Bergdahl himself--an idealistic, misguided soldier onto whom a nation projected the political and emotional complications of service. <br><br>Based on years of exclusive reporting drawing on dozens of sources throughout the military, government, and Bergdahl's family, friends, and fellow soldiers, <i>American Cipher</i> is at once a meticulous investigation of government dysfunction and political posturing, a blistering commentary on America's presence in Afghanistan, and a heartbreaking story of a na�ve young man who thought he could fix the world and wound up the tool of forces far beyond his understanding.</p><p><b>Matt Farwell</b> is a freelance writer whose work has appeared in <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>Vanity Fair</i>, <i>Rolling Stone</i>, <i>Men's Journal</i>, <i>Playboy</i>, and other publications. He was an Army infantryman for five years, including sixteen months in Afghanistan. He lives in Fayetteville, Arkansas.<br><br><b>Michael Ames </b>is a regular contributor to <i>Newsweek</i> and <i>Harper's</i>. His work has also appeared in <i>The Atlantic</i>, Slate, The Daily Beast, and <i>The Believer</i>. He spent nine years in Idaho working as a newspaper reporter and magazine editor, and now lives in Brooklyn.&nbsp;&#x201c;Compelling. . . . In&nbsp;<i>American Cipher</i>&nbsp;the specific facts of Bergdahl&#x2019;s case are elevated to the allegorical, and this is where Farwell and Ames&#x2019;s storytelling really shines. . . . Farwell and Ames convincingly show that so many of the reasons we&#x2019;ve been fighting in Afghanistan for 18 years&#x2014;bureaucratic inertia, partisan dysfunction, domestic indifference&#x2014;are the same reasons that, even when Bergdahl&#x2019;s captors eagerly hoped to broker his release, it took so long to recover him.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Elliot Ackerman,&nbsp;<i>The Washington Post</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Farwell and Ames convincingly rebut popular misconceptions about the then-23-year-old Private Bowe Bergdahl&#x2019;s desertion of his post in Afghanistan in 2009. . . . The authors humanize their subject with a detailed look at his life before Afghanistan. . . . The engrossing narrative intertwines Bergdahl&#x2019;s odyssey with an effective critique of U.S. policy in Afghanistan under both Republican and Democratic administrations. Readers looking for a nontechnical history of America&#x2019;s longest war and a nuanced look at Bergdahl&#x2019;s story will find that here.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b><i>Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review</b><br><br>&#x201c;Farwell and Ames recount the complete Bergdahl saga and much of the sorry tale of America&#x2019;s Afghanistan involvement. They move effortlessly between Bergdahl&#x2019;s life. . . and the larger picture of the war and the American political divisions over it. . . . Farwell and Ames make a great case for the continuum of history, depicting Afghanistan as a graveyard of empires in which the U.S. is the latest victim of a military quagmire and showing how one soldier&#x2019;s actions can polarize an entire nation. <i>American Cipher </i>sets the record straight on a tragic subject and will strongly appeal to a wide audience.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b><i>Booklist,&nbsp;</i>starred review</b><br><br>&#x201c;After his capture by Islamic terrorists, during five years of imprisonment at undisclosed locations across the border of Pakistan, every moment in Bowe Bergdahl&#x2019;s existence became fodder for controversy at an international level. The authors present compelling, convincing evidence that addresses each specific controversial element. . . . An unsettling and riveting book filled with the mysteries of human nature.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b><i>Kirkus</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The authors raise important questions about the psychological fitness of servicemen and -women and the diminishing chances for fair trials and treatment in a nation as polarized as ours today. This will resonate with readers gripped by C.J. Chivers&#x2019;s <i>The Fighters</i>.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b><i>Library Journal</i> </b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>American Cipher</i> is a riveting journalistic account of Bowe Bergdahl&#x2019;s disastrous&#x2014;and weirdly poignant&#x2014;choice to walk off his military base in Afghanistan. Avoiding easy outrage, Matt Farwell and Michael Ames do their best to understand what motivated Bergdahl&#x2019;s wildly irresponsible decision. For in that decision lie truths not only of a troubled mind but also of a troubled nation engaged in a seemingly endless war. This is a spectacularly good book about an incredibly painful and important topic.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Sebastian Junger, author of <i>Tribe</i> and <i>War</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This excellent book is a cautionary tale about what happens when a confused and misguided young soldier is sent off to fight for an equally confused and misguided foreign policy.<b>&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Karl Marlantes, author of</b><i><b>&nbsp;<i>Matterhorn</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>What It Is Like To Go To War</i></b><br></i></b><br>&#x201c;Matt Farwell and Michael Ames have written a vitally important book. As an account of Bowe Bergdahl&#x2019;s captivity and eventual release, <i>American Cipher</i> is compelling. Yet it&#x2019;s the backstory that really matters: The crippling dysfunction that permeates the U.S. war effort in Afghanistan, beginning in the combat zone and extending all the way back to Washington.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Andrew Bacevich, author of <i>Twilight of the American Century<br></i></b> <br>&#x201c;Bowe Bergdahl&#x2019;s story should be required reading for all Americans, illuminating as it does so many aspects of an ill-conceived conflict. <i>American Cipher</i> shines a cold, clear light not just on an unending war, but also on the society that pays for it in countless ways. A fascinating book.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Andrew Cockburn, author of <i>Kill Chain</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Matt Farwell and Michael Ames brilliantly reconstruct Bowe Bergdahl&#x2019;s journey and provide a damning portrait of America&#x2019;s role in Afghanistan, revealing the larger truth of why the U.S. has failed and why the war means unending tragedy for the Afghan people.<i>&nbsp;American Cipher</i>&nbsp;is haunting and moving, a deeply human study of an inhuman conflict. It is one of the most important books I&#x2019;ve read about the Afghan war.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Anand Gopal, author of <i>No Good Men Among the Living</i></b></p><h2>Fodor&#39;s In Focus Santa Fe: with Taos and Albuquerque (Travel Guide)</h2><p><b></b><p><b>Written by locals, <i>Fodor&#x2019;s InFocus Santa Fe</i> is the perfect guidebook for those looking for insider tips to make the most out their visit to Santa Fe, Taos and Albuquerque.

Sumptuous, all-new photography features over one hundred masterpieces, created by forty-five artists, from the Metropolitan Museum of Art&#x2019;s renowned collection. Each chapter focuses on a specific designer, and includes a biography and discussions of the objects, enlivened by generous quotes from contemporary writings. As one of the only English volumes devoted to French Art Deco, this is a significant contribution to the study and appreciation of the style.</p><p>This impressive survey of French Art Deco contains alluring photographs that render the book as worthy of display as the objects pictured within it.<br><b>Jared Goss</b> is an independent scholar and former associate curator in the Department of Modern and Contemporary Art at The Metropolitan Museum of Art.<br></p><h2>Patterns of the Hypnotic Techniques of Milton H. Erickson, M.D, Vol. 1</h2><p>This volume is the first in a series of studies of the patterns of hypnotic techniques employed by Milton H. Erickson. In this first volume, we have focused primarily on the verbal patterns which Erickson uses in his work. Furthermore, our emphasis here has been on the portions of his work dealing with the induction of trance and the use of suggestion for assisting the client in accomplishing the objectives of trance work. We intend to shift the emphasis of the furture volumes to other patterns. The Table of Contents which we include for Volume II of Patterns will give the reader some notion of this future emphasis.

The year was 1957. The place was an ordinary farmhouse in America's heartland, filled with extraordinary evidence of unthinkable depravity. The man behind the massacre was a slight, unassuming Midwesterner with a strange smile -- and even stranger attachment to his domineering mother. After her death and a failed attempt to dig up his mother's body from the local cemetery, Gein turned to other grave robberies and, ultimately, multiple murders. Driven to commit gruesome and bizarre acts beyond all imagining, Ed Gein remains one of the most deranged minds in the annals of American homicide. This is his story -- recounted in fascinating and chilling detail by Harold Schechter, one of the most acclaimed true-crime storytellers of our time.</p><p></p></p><p>Harold Schechter is a historian: he takes old files and yellowed newspaper clippings, and brings their stories to life. <i>Deviant</i> is about everyone's favorite ghoul, Ed Gein--whose crimes inspired the writers of <i>Psycho</i>, <i>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i>, and <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i>. Schechter deftly evokes the small-town 1950s Wisconsin setting--not pretty farms and cheese factories, but infertile soil and a bleak, hardscrabble existence. The details of Gein's "death house" are perhaps well known by now, but the murderer's quietly crazy, almost gentle personality comes forth in this book as never before. As Gary Kadet wrote, in <i>The Boston Book Review</i>, "Schechter is a dogged researcher [who backs up] every bizarre detail and curious twist in this and his other books ... More importantly, he nimbly avoids miring his writing and our reading with minutiae or researched overstatement, which means that although he can occasionally be dry, he is never boring." <br> Also recommended: Schechter's books about Albert Fish (<i>Deranged</i>) and Herman Mudgett a.k.a. Dr. H. H. Holmes (<i>Depraved</i>).<b>Harold Schechter</b> is a professor of American literature and culture. Renowned for his true-crime writing, he is the author of the nonfiction books <i>Fatal, Fiend, Bestial, Deviant, Deranged, Depraved,</i> and, with David Everitt, <i>The A to Z Encyclopedia of Serial Killers</i>. He is also the author of <i>Nevermore</i> and <i>The Hum Bug</i>, the acclaimed historical novels featuring Edgar Allan Poe. He lives in New York State.</p><h2>The Joy of Cooking</h2><p>Book is in Acceptable Condition.

In addition to hundreds of brand-new recipes, this <i>Joy</i> is filled with many recipes from all previous editions, retested and reinvented for today's tastes. <p> Take the new <i>Joy</i> for a test-run in the kitchen with these featured recipes for Roast Brined Turkey and Apple Pie, and watch a video demonstration for their recipe for 10-in-One Cookies. And read on for celebrity chef "Odes to <i>Joy</i>," <i>Joy</i> timeline, and <i>Joy</i> trivia. </p> <br><b>Odes to <i>Joy</i></b><br> <p></p><br> "Great cookbooks are not just collections of interesting recipes. They are, first and foremost, books that tell a story, the story of how people lived and cooked at a particular point in time. They reveal, to borrow an expression from James Beard, their delights and prejudices, their view of the social order, their appetite for serving others food that meets the expectations of their social class. Food can be anything and everything from fuel to an object of intellectual curiosity to full-bore hedonism that transports the mind and body far from the dinner table with just one overwhelming bite. <p> I started cooking out of an early edition of Joy when I was only 7 years old. I remember making a basic chocolate cake with 7-minute frosting. The cake turned out fine, but the frosting resembled gruel and was my introduction to the importance of following a recipe to the letter. Evidently my lack of patience and precision had led me astray. But after that first brush with culinary failure, <i>Joy</i> led me to many, many successes over the years; more to the point, I became enamored of Ms. Rombauer's voice, the matter-of-fact charm that led her to suggest "stand facing the stove" as a sensible first step in any recipe. </p><p> The amateur but highly evolved enthusiasm that Irma Rombauer brought to the world of home cooking was a breath of fresh air after the slightly earlier era of culinary dowagers Fannie Farmer, Mrs. Beaton, and Marion Harland. To those pillars of culinary wisdom, recipes were shorthand for cooks who had spent a lifetime in the kitchen. A pie pastry recipe might be written as "make a paste." But Ms. Rombauer was there to hold our hands, to put food in a social context and give it attitude, energy, and meaning in a world where food was leaping past the narrow formality of the Victorian age. </p><p> For all of our worldly knowledge about ingredients and culinary custom, few cookbook authors have managed to perfectly capture, without artifice or self-conscious chatter, the vernacular of an age. Irma Rombauer introduced us to a room in our home--the kitchen--that was to become a place of enjoyment, not just one of backbreaking labor. She represented the essence of the new American experience, which suggested that everything in life could be transformed into pleasure with nothing more than the proper attitude. And what better way to celebrate this new age than to have a smashing cocktail party with the perfect hors d&#x2019;oeuvres? </p><p> The original <i>Joy of Cooking</i> was mind over matter, the perfect mix of attitude and function. Even as times have changed, the <i>Joy</i> stands out as a watershed volume, a book that speaks to the very heart of who we want to be in the kitchen: producers of our own story, directors of the good American life. </p><p> And, according to Ms. Rombauer, all we have to do is take that first easy step and "stand facing the stove." <b>--Christopher Kimball, founder and editor of <i>Cook's Illustrated</i></b> <br> <br> "I'm often asked to pick my favorite cookbook. Considering that there are over 3,000 cookbooks published each year, it's a daunting task to try to narrow them down. Speaking as a chef who never went to cooking school, I've been enthralled by certain cookbooks, immersing myself from cover to cover and learning about exotic cuisines from all over the world. But for just plain basic information, both the original and revised <i>Joy of Cooking</i> are still my bibles. I can't tell you how many times my wife Jackie and I have thumbed through the stained and broken-backed copy of <i>Joy</i> in our home kitchen, looking for our favorite angel food cake recipe, our favorite skillet corn bread, our favorite fluffy biscuits, and crisp waffles, and on and on. It's tough to picture my family table--or, in fact, the American table--without a well-worn copy of <i>Joy of Cooking</i> in the background." " <b>--Tom Douglas, author of <i>I Love Crab Cakes!</i></b> <br> <br> "I highly recommend this book as a must-have in your kitchen. Chock full of great information, this book takes all of the guess work out and leaves no stone unturned." <b>--Paula Deen, author of <i>Paula Deen Celebrates!</i></b><br> "In our kitchen, <i>Joy of Cooking</i> is a tool as indispensable as the chef's knife, the scale, the whisk. We actually own two copies--a shelf-copy for reading, and one whose sauce-splattered, dog-eared pages bear witness to just how much joy we get from <i>Joy</i>." " <b>--Matt Lee and Ted Lee, authors of <i>The Lee Bros. Southern Cookbook</i></b><br> "<i>Joy of Cooking</i> is the ultimate reference guide that I have been using for years. It's timeless and packed with perfect recipes for the home cook that stands up to the test of time." <b> --Tyler Florence, author of <i>Tyler's Ultimate</i></b><br> "<i>Joy of Cooking</i> is a book I turn to whenever I have a question about food or cooking. The new edition is the combined effort of some of the best cooks writing today; I know I can trust its information. And trust is, to my mind, the essential quality of all great cookbooks." <b>--Sally Schneider, author of <i>The Improvisational Cook</i></b><br> "When Andrew first contemplated becoming a chef in the 1980s, he asked two Boston chefs of his acquaintance what books he should read. Each independently recommended <i>Joy of Cooking</i> as <i>THE</i> classic with reliable recipes for just about everything. (The second chef urged him to look for an early copy for the sheer entertainment value of reading how to cook a possum.) A decade later, when we interviewed 60 of America&#x2019;s leading chefs for our first book <i>Becoming a Chef</i>, we asked them the same question--and again <i>Joy</i> was one of their five most recommended books. In fact, we recommend buying two copies, like we did: we keep our chocolate-smudged copy of <i>Joy</i> in our kitchen, and a reading copy on our bookshelves." <b>--Andrew Dorenburg and Karen Page, authors of <i>What to Drink with What You Eat</i></b><br> "Our <i>Joy of Cooking</i> is dog-eared, flour dusted, chocolate smudged, oil spattered, and easily the most used cookbook on the shelf. The staggering amount of information in the book taught us the basics when we were in our teens and has informed our cooking for the decades since. We wish we had written it!" <b>--Johanne Killeen and George Germon, authors of <i>On Top of Spaghetti</i></b><br> "I received a copy of <i>Joy of Cooking</i> in my late teens. I have treasured the cookbook ever since and still use it frequently as a reference. In the late 80's I was asked to represent American Cooking in Italy. I cooked all over the country for 2 months. The only book I took was <i>Joy of Cooking</i>. When ingredients that I had ordered did not show up and I had to totally wing it, I used this book to get me out of a few jams--like what the proportions are to make your own baking powder! If I could have only one cookbook--other than my own of course!--it would be <i>Joy of Cooking</i>&#x2013;-as it is the bible of American cooking" <b>--Kathy Casey, author of <i>Kathy Casey's Northwest Table</i></b><br> "I have purchased <i>Joy of Cooking</i> for all my restaurant libraries as well as my own.

It's the book your grandmother and mother probably learned to cook from, the book you gave your sister when she got married. This, the first revision in more than twenty years, is better than ever. Here's why: Every chapter has been rethought with an emphasis on freshness, convenience, and health. All the recipes have been reconceived and tested with an eye to modern taste, and the cooking knowledge imparted with each subject enriched to the point where everyone from a beginning to an experienced cook will feel completely supported. The new Joy continues the vision of American cooking that began with the first edition of Joy. It is still the book you can turn to for perfect Beef Wellington and Baked Macaroni and Cheese. It's also the book where you can now find Turkey on the Grill, Spicy Peanut Sesame Noodles, and vegetarian meals. The new Joy provides more thorough descriptions of ingredients, from the familiar to the most exotic. For instance, almost all the varieties of apples grown domestically are described -- the months they become available, how they taste, what they are best used for, and how long they keep. But for the first time Joy features a complete section on fresh and dried chili peppers: how to roast and grill them, how to store them, and how long they keep -- with illustrations of each pepper. An all-new "RULES" section in many chapters gives essential cooking basics at a glance: washing and storing salad greens, selecting a pasta and a matching sauce, determining when a piece of fish is cooked through, stuffing a chicken, and making a perfect souffle. New chapters reflect changing American tastes and lifestyles: Separate new chapters on grains, beans, and pasta include recipes for grits, polenta, pilafs, risottos, vegetarian chills, bean casseroles, and make-ahead lasagnes. New baking and dessert chapters promise to enhance Joy of Cooking's reputation as a bible for bakers. Quick and yeast bread recipes range from focaccia, pizza, and sourdoughs to muffins and coffee cakes. Separate chapters cover custards and puddings, pies and tarts, cookies, cakes, cobblers, and other American fruit desserts revived for this edition. Recipes include one-bowl cakes, gingerbread, angel and sponge cakes, meringues, pound cakes, fruitcakes, 6 different kinds of cheesecake -- there's even an illustrated wedding cake recipe, which takes you through all the stages from building a stand, making and decorating the cake, to transporting it to the reception without a hitch. Little Dishes showcases foods from around the world: hummus, baba ghanoush, bruschetta, tacos, empanadas, and fried wontons. AII new drawings of techniques, ingredients, and equipment, integrated throughout an elegant new design, and over 300 more pages round out the new Joy. </p><p>Among this book's other unique features: microwave instructions for preparing beans, grains, and vegetables; dozens of new recipes for people who are lactose intolerant and allergic to gluten; expanded ingredients chart now features calories, essential vitamins, and levels of fats and cholesterol. There are ideas for substitutions to lower fat in recipes and reduced-fat recipes in the baking sections. </p><p>From cover to cover, Joy's chapters have been imbued with the knowledge and passion of America's greatest cooks and cooking teachers. An invaluable combination of old and new, this edition of Joy of Cooking promises to keep you cooking for years to come.</p></p><h2>Plant Partners: Creative Plant Associations for Perennials</h2><p>Magical planting suggestions from today&#39;s most compelling garden writer. Herbaceous perennials are the star performers in the garden. But to create maximum impact they need the right partners, and knowing which plant to put with which is an art that often eludes even the most knowledgeable of gardeners. Here, Anna Pavord helps to solve this tantalizing problem by suggesting 60 plants that she feels deserve a place in every garden -- her star plants -- and to accompany them, two ideal partners. She shows, season by season, how to create irresistible planting associations that juxtapose texture, shape, color, and scent. In these small-scale recipes she uses perennials, annuals, and bulbs that either perform simultaneously or dovetail to provide interest for most of the year. To extend the options, she also gives scores of alternatives for each combination. Stunning photographs and Anna&#39;s unique ability to awaken us to the delights and idiosyncrasies of these, her favorite plants, work together to provide a marvelous source of planting ideas. These can be visited time and time again, whether we want merely to fill one small gap, transform an awkward corner, or start a whole new border from scratch.</p><p>Anna Pavord has no patience for dwarf plants ("a perverse trend"), pastels ("Stop overdosing on pastels. We've had more than enough of them"), or winter gardens ("Who needs them? The pleasures of the winter garden are only for masochists"), not to mention all-white beds ("somnambulist gardening"). She has a sharp eye and a predilection for cheeky Briticisms, and she's not afraid to use either. <i>Plant Partners</i> is organized into seasons--the <i>real</i> growing seasons: signs of spring, spring turns to summer, high summer, and into autumn. Within these seasons Pavord presents 60 "star" plants that should be highlighted in the perennial bed. For each of her favorite plants she provides a supporting cast of two varieties--annuals, bulbs, or perennials--that partner particularly well with the stars, and under the same soil and light conditions. The groupings might be designed so that all of the flowers will be in bloom at once (pasqueflower with grape hyacinth and deep-purple primroses, for example), or so that when one flower's blooms are just starting to fade another's are waiting in the wings (lily-of-the-valley with a hellebore and barrenwort). A listing of "alternative" partners extends the range of choices to include more unusual plants and ones that might be more challenging to grow. Foliage is given as much consideration as blooms: <blockquote>"Darling! Salmon! How brave!" exclaim the white-garden brigade as they sharpen their pruning knives for a horticultural mercy killing. You might as well fall on your garden fork there and then as try to explain that the point of the rodgersia they are looking at is not the buff-pink flower but the whirls of bronze underneath it.</blockquote> But her exhortation to use foliage--as well as grasses and nonflowering perennials as "star" plants--to best advantage cannot be ignored in <i>Plant Partners</i>. Pavord's advice throughout is practical and opinionated. <i>--Liana Fredley</i>The Tulip, the result of Anna Pavord&#39;s lifelong passion for this particular bulb, won her worldwide acclaim and almost started a second bout of tulip mania. Indeed her enthusiasm for plants, combined with her ability to evoke in words their many quirks and charms, make her one of the most entertaining yet informative of garden writers. Anna has written many highly successful books, including The Border Book and New Kitchen Garden, both published by Dorling Kindersley. In the UK, she writes regularly for the magazine Gardens Illustrated, where she is also associate editor, and contributes a weekly column to The Independent newspaper. She is a frequent radio broadcaster and has also presented her own TV series about gardening. Anna is an avid traveler, gleaning information about plants in many corners of the world. Back home in Dorset, England, she uses her large garden -- around an old rectory -- as a source of inspiration and a place where she can constantly experiment with new associations of flowers and foliage.</p><h2>Creating the Commonwealth: The Economic Culture of Puritan New England</h2><p><p><strong>This ambitious history offers a sweeping reinterpretation of America's cultural roots in the colonial past.</strong></p> Marshaling rich new evidence, Innes focuses on enterprise in early New England and its relation to the prevailing culture of Puritanism. He finds in our beginnings at Massachusetts Bay a fierce devotion to God that fed a social commitment to engage the world and prosper. The result was a thriving capitalism and a diminishing devotion which alarmed Puritan leaders in the late seventeenth century. While telling the story of Massachusetts Bay's transformation from a resource-poor perch on the continent to an active international economy, Innes supplies wonderful detail on early New England's ironworks, fisheries, shipyards, and the "Scums and dreggs" who provided the labor for Puritan enterprise.</p><p>Stephen Innes, professor of history at the University of Virginia, has written extensively on the social history of colonial America.How did the Puritan settlers of Massachusetts Bay Colony, within just a generation of its founding in 1630 and against enormous odds, establish a thriving, diversified, family-based economy? In illuminating this phenomenon, Innes's impressive revisionist study sweeps away conventional notions of mercantile New England as a place of rugged individualism and economic backwardness. He shows that individualistic striving was anchored in a communal context whereby family, church, town organizations and commonwealth linked personal to collective well-being, providing a counterweight to unbridled capitalistic behavior. Innes, a University of Virginia history professor, argues persuasively that the Puritans' sustaining myth of redemptive community?their belief that they were a chosen, "convenant people" working out God's designs?imbued economic development with spiritual purpose. Massachusetts, the crucible of America's Puritan work ethic, in Innes's estimate achieved a "moral capitalism" with levels of prosperity, education, family stability and life expectancy unrivaled in British America. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Multispecies Salon</h2><p>A new approach to writing culture has arrived: multispecies ethnography.

In this dramatically plotted book, organized around crucial turning points in 1914, 1918, and 1933, Peter Fritzsche explains why the Nazis were so popular and what was behind the political choice made by the German people. </p><p> Rejecting the view that Germans voted for the Nazis simply because they hated the Jews, or had been humiliated in World War I, or had been ruined by the Great Depression, Fritzsche makes the controversial argument that Nazism was part of a larger process of democratization and political invigoration that began with the outbreak of World War I. </p><p> The twenty-year period beginning in 1914 was characterized by the steady advance of a broad populist revolution that was animated by war, drew strength from the Revolution of 1918, menaced the Weimar Republic, and finally culminated in the rise of the Nazis. Better than anyone else, the Nazis twisted together ideas from the political Left and Right, crossing nationalism with social reform, anti-Semitism with democracy, fear of the future with hope for a new beginning. This radical rebelliousness destroyed old authoritarian structures as much as it attacked liberal principles. </p><p> The outcome of this dramatic social revolution was a surprisingly popular regime that drew on public support to realize its horrible racial goals. Within a generation, Germans had grown increasingly self-reliant and sovereign, while intensely nationalistic and chauvinistic. They had recast the nation, but put it on the road to war and genocide. </p></p><p>One of the four key archival photographs in this history of the rise of the Nazi state shows a young, disheveled Hitler among the throng of "patriotic Germans gathered on Munich's Odeonsplatz to hear the declaration of war read aloud from the steps of the Feldherrnhalle on 2 August 1914." Fritzsche analyzes the exact significance of this moment to Hitler and the German population. To de-emphasize, in this manner, the Nazis' rise from the rubble of economic despair and hardship and to posit their birth in this popular movement represents a shift in the more conventional historic point of view that dates Nazism at the end of World War I (1918). In the moment captured by this photograph, the German <i>Volk</i> was in the process of being born.<p> The <i>Volk</i> becomes a crucial entity as Fritzsche scrutinizes the evolution of Germans into Nazis. The Nazis rose to power "because [they] spoke so well to [the peoples'] interests and inclinations. Given the illiberal aims and violent means of the Nazis, this popular support is a sobering, dreadful thing." The Nazi revolution offered a complex and vicious intertwining of the Left and Right that amounted to a reckless rebelliousness and the crossing of nationalism with social reform, anti-Semitism with democracy, and paranoia with nationalistic zeal for a new beginning. Their rise spanned a remarkably short period--from 1914 to 1933. Each of the four chapters opens with an archival photograph that represents a key point in the evolution of this dreadful rise.</p><p> The pivotal November 1918 event, for example, was the call by the <i>Volk</i> for the abdication of the Kaiser, exemplified by the unprecedented demonstration of socialist workers in the government quarters. It would take just a few hours for the old order to crumble and Germany to declare itself a socialist republic. Leap ahead to January 1933. Hitler had just been made chancellor of Germany. Here is a description of the swelling crowds and celebratory atmosphere: "Nearly one million Berliners took part in this extraordinary demonstration of allegiance to a party that promised to do away with both the sentimental bric-a-brac of the prewar past and the clutter of Weimar democracy and to establish a strong-willed and strong-armed racial state...." In the meantime, Communists, Socialists, and Jews were being severely beaten. Fritzsche cites the dramatic overpowering of German towns and the harrowing popularity of Nazi brutality as he sheds light on Hitler's immense popularity. Fervent nationalism and an overarching anti-Semitism weigh in heavily. This is a history that seeks not to exonerate but to tell the cautionary tale. <i>--Hollis Giammatteo</i></p>Peter Fritzsche, in his Germans into Nazis, makes a...crucial point about public opinion in the 1930s and 1940s. He recalls-and this is something that foreigners living in Germany have always understood more readily than academics-that the popular appeal of Hitler&#39;s movement lay much more in the hope and optimism it generated than in its various invitations to hate and to fear.-Neal Ascherson, Los Angeles Times Book Review</p><h2>Color Me Confident: Expert guidance to help you feel confident and look great</h2><p>Every woman knows that if you feel great on the outside, you are confident on the inside.

Intense wind and cold, the mountains swept clean of everything but moss, lichen, snow, and ice, the largest tree an 8-inch-high birch. Why would a young man choose to live totally alone in this unforgiving environment, hunting and trapping, never for a moment able to take his daily survival for granted? Ivar Ruud did it for adventure and freedom, and because it was a challenge that only a handful of other men had ever faced. Trapped in his cabin for days at a time by fierce storms, awakened by polar-bear claws slashing at his sleeping bag, left nearly helpless for two weeks after breaking his hand trying to force fighting sled dogs apart - all these adventurous sides of Ivar&#39;s remarkable Arctic life are told with a rare sense of immediacy that often leaves the reader literally chilled. But there is another side to this vivid narrative, a depth of human feeling that reveals Ivar Ruud as a man with a profound, poetic appreciation and respect for the polar world he comes to accept - even love - on its own harshly beautiful terms. The Year-Long Day is a classic story of survival that enhances the reader&#39;s sense of life itself.</p><p></p><h2>Creative Curriculum Learning Games: 12-24 Months</h2><p>Transforms the fundamentals of early childhood development into easy-to-use, flexible activities.

Is gun-related violence so deeply embedded in American historical experience as to be immutable? The accepted answers to these questions are "mythology," says Michael A. Bellesiles.<br><br>Basing his arguments on sound and prodigious research, Bellesiles makes it clear that gun ownership was the exception--even on the frontier--until the age of industrialization. In Colonial America the average citizen had virtually no access to or training in the use of firearms, and the few guns that did exist were kept under strict control. No guns were made in America until after the Revolution, and there were few gunsmiths to keep them in repair.<br><br>Bellesiles shows that the U.S. government, almost from its inception, worked to arm its citizens, but it met only public indifference and resistance until the 1850s, when technological advances--such as repeating revolvers with self-contained bullets--contributed to a surge in gun manufacturing. Finally, we see how the soaring gun production engendered by the Civil War, and the decision to allow soldiers to keep their weapons at the end of the conflict, transformed the gun from a seldom-needed tool to a perceived necessity--opposing ideas that are still at the center of the fight for and against gun control today.<br><br>Michael A. Bellesiles's research set off a chain of passionate reaction after its publication in the <i>Journal of American History</i> in 1996, and <b>Arming America</b> is certain to be one of the most controversial and widely read books on the subject.</p><p>While gun supporters use the nation's gun-toting history in defense of their way of life, and revolutionary enthusiasts replay skirmishes on historic battlefields, it now turns out that America has not always had a gun culture, and wide-scale gun ownership is much newer than we think. After a 10-year search for "a world that isn't there," professor and scholar Michael Bellesiles discovered that Americans not only rarely owned guns prior to the Civil War, they wouldn't even take them for free from a government that <i>wanted</i> to arm its reluctant public. No sharpshooters, no gun in every home, no children learning to hunt beside their fathers. Bellesiles--whose research methods have generated a great deal of controversy and even a subsequent investigation by Emory University--searched legal, probate, military, and business records; fiction and personal letters; hunting magazines; and legislation in his quest for the legendary gun-wielding frontiersman, only to discover that he is a myth. There are other revelations: gun ownership and storage was strictly legislated in colonial days, and frivolous shooting of a musket was backed by the death penalty; men rarely died in duels because the guns were far too inaccurate (duels were about honor, not murder); pioneers didn't hunt (they trapped and farmed); frontier folk loved books, not guns; and the militia never won a war (it was too inept). In fact, prior to the Civil War, when mass production of higher quality guns became a reality, the republic's greatest problem was a dearth of guns, and a public that was too peaceable to care about civil defense. As Bellesiles writes, "Probably the major reason why the American Revolution lasted eight years, longer than any war in American history before Vietnam, was that when that brave patriot reached above the mantel, he pulled down a rusty, decaying, unusable musket (not a rifle), or found no gun there at all." Strangely, the eagle-eye frontiersman was created by East Coast fiction writers, while the idea of a gun as a household necessity was an advertising ploy of gun maker Samuel Colt (both just prior to the Civil War). The former group fabricated a historic and heroic past while Colt preyed on overblown fears of Indians and blacks. <p>Bellesiles, who is highly knowledgeable about weapons and military history, never comes out against guns. He is more interested in discovering the truth than in taking sides. Nevertheless, his work shatters some time-honored myths and icons--including the usual reading of the Second Amendment--and will be hard to refute. This fascinating, eye-opening account is sure to both inform and inflame the already highly charged debate about guns in America. <i>--Lesly Reed</i></p>"<b>Arming America</b> is a myth-busting tour de force.

Young, Senior Research Fellow, Newberry Library<br><br>"At long last a superb book that systematically dismantles one of our most cherished and dangerous national myths. Bellesiles has made a major contribution to a significant public policy debate."<br>-- Robert C. Ritchie, Director of Research, The Huntington Library<br><br>"<b>Arming America</b> is an astonishingly original and innovative book, chock full of fascinating revelations. It ought to raise current controversies about gun control to a more fact-based and rational level. It is certain to endure as a classic work of significant scholarship with inescapable policy implications." <br>--Michael Kammen, Past President, Organization of American Historians<br><br>"This book changes everything. The way we think about guns and violence in America will never be the same. Neither will our notions of manhood, race, the rise of big business, or our national character. Neither will our understanding of the Second Amendment. Michael Bellesiles is the NRA's worst nightmare."<br>-- Michael Zuckerman, author of <i>Peaceable Kingdoms</i><br><br>"Bellesiles has uncovered one of the most profound ironies in American history. The contemporary debate about the role of guns in American society has actually-- turned history on its head. While many early Americans rallied at their government for doing too little to arm the American people, some in contemporary America now rail at their government for seeking to limit access to weapons.-- No one interested in the controversial problem of guns in American society can afford to ignore this important book."<br>--Saul Cornell, author of <i>The Other Founders</i><br><br>"Michael Bellesiles' work shifts the terms of the debate about the gun's place in the modern United States. Today we assume that the gun has always been central to American culture. Those who seek to limit its prevalence have largely accepted that they ask us to depart from a tradition of long standing. Bellesiles argues, however, that the centrality of guns is a recent phenomenon, dating form the mid-19th century. His research raises fundamental issues that go to the heart of widely-held but apparently erroneous assumptions about American gun culture."<br>-- Carla Gardina Pestana, author of <i>Liberty of Conscience and the Growth of Religious Diversity in Early America</i><br><br>"This is a book for scholars and, above all, citizens, a wonderful work that bring historical insight and plain good sense to a critical national debate. With wit, commitment, and an unerring command of his argument, Michael Bellesiles shows us that gun culture has not always been embedded in American culture in the past - and perhaps doesn't have to be in the future. It's a lesson we all need to learn from a book we all need to read." <br>-- Greg Nobles, author of <i>American Frontiers</i></p><h2>Encore: A Journal of the Eightieth Year</h2><p><p><strong>In this affirmative journal, May Sarton describes both hardships and joys in the daily round of her life in old age&#x2015;physical struggles counterbalanced by the satisfactions of friendship, nature, critical recognition, and creative spark.</strong></p> Sarton writes perceptively of how age affects her: the way small things take longer and tire more, what it feels like to endure pain and to be afraid. Other days her energy returns, her spirits lift, and projects abound. Readers both new and old will cherish this latest dispatch from her ongoing journey.<br></p><p>May Sarton (1912-1995) was an acclaimed poet, novelist, and memoirist.As Gloria Steinem might say, this is what 80 looks like: a pale paean to flowers, food, and friends. Sarton's novel As We Are Now (1973)--a brilliant and moving fictional journal of life (and death) in a nursing home--makes this memoir pallid by comparison, and the problems of inconsequential, lackluster writing that appeared in Sarton's earlier journals of infirmity and old age (Endgame, 1992, etc.) crop up here as well. The life cycle of the flowers on the author's Maine estate are documented in detail; lunches, dinners, and flower arrangements provided by friends and ``fans'' are described exquisitely; pain (apparently caused by intestinal blockage), medication, and visits to the holistic doctor who monitors the author's diet are carefully depicted. Sarton's joy in her cat, her many visitors (especially friend Susan, who frequently comes bearing roses but who isn't otherwise identified), and her fan mail is matched by the burden she feels in answering letters, letting in her cat at 1:00 a.m. (and sometimes again at 4:00 a.m.), and checking the weather. But the last handful of entries here reminds us of Sarton the well- regarded novelist and poet. In them, apparently in response to improving health, she switches from dictating into a tape recorder to writing the day's events, and from simple sentences in which ``wonderful'' is the adjective du jour to a richer, more thoughtful prose style. This is her last journal, Sarton says; her next project will be a novella based on a recent trip to England. Sarton's energy and focus are inspiring--but readers looking for analysis or fresh literary gossip won't find them here. (Photographs--not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Larry Crabb and Dan Allender, it is the most basic form of counseling -- a skill that can be mastered by laypeople as well as counselors. What must we know in order to fulfill the biblical exhortation to &#39;encourage one another&#39;? Encouragement: The Key to Caring tells you. Part one deals with understanding encouragement, and part two explores the process of encouragement, including such practical how-tos as - developing a careful selection of encouraging words - cultivating active listening skills - using biblical fellowship to move beyond superficial smiles and shallow greetings - recognizing subtle opportunities for encouragement -- Without the encouragement of a caring community, biblical truth taught in church tends to just thicken people&#39;s defense layers. But authenticity, freedom, and greater love for God and others are the fruit of encouragement, and evidence of the tremendous power God invests in individuals and churches who practice it.</p><p>Dr. Larry Crabb, Ph.D., is a well-known speaker, author of numerous best-selling books including God of My Father, Finding God, and Men and Women, and Distinguished Scholar-in-Residence at Colorado Christian University in Morrison.

In each case Rudofsky brings to his subject a singular blend of erudition, wit, and insight that makes the exotic seem logical and the commonplace bizarre....Rudofsky&#39;s cogent arguments are amply documented with over 100 of his unparalleled photographs, in addition to many more rare engravings and other illustrations. The total effect is to expand far beyond dictionary definitions our concepts of both architecture and the human spirit.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Beric The Briton: A Story of the Roman Invasion (Works of G.

No one knew then that she would become an international music legend, but what she knew&#x2014;as words of wisdom passed down from her grandfather&#x2014;was that "if you can think it, you can do it." And she did it. Dionne released the first of more than fifty-six charted hits in 1962 with "Don&#x2019;t Make Me Over," followed by "Anyone Who Had a Heart," "Walk On By," "I Say a Little Prayer," "Alfie," and "A House Is Not a Home," to name a few. She received her first Grammy in 1968 for "Do You Know the Way to San Jose" and later recorded the classic hit "That&#x2019;s What Friends Are For." She was considered the voice of Burt Bacharach/Hal David compositions, and the rest is here, in her first autobiography. Dionne tells the stories of her life from her childhood in East Orange, New Jersey, in a two-family home with her parents, brother, and sister, to now, as she celebrates her fiftieth year in show business. <br><br>She came by her musical gifts honestly. Her mother, Lee Drinkard Warrick, was a founding member of the legendary Drinkard Jubilairs, which included her mother&#x2019;s siblings Cissy, Marie, Annie, Nick, and Larry. Cissy went on to become a celebrated recording artist in her own right; she lived in the Warrick household, got married, and later gave birth to one of the most popular singers of our time, Whitney Houston. Dionne went on to start her own gospel group with her sister, Dee Dee, called the Gospelaires. Her father, once a Pullman porter, became an accountant, went on to promote gospel records for Hob Records, and wrote a book on gospel music. She attributes her strong family, who are faithful and industrious Christians, for keeping her grounded and giving her the fortitude, as well as the talent, to earn her place among world-class performing artists without losing herself or her soul.</p><p><b>Dionne Warwick </b>was born in East Orange, New Jersey, in 1940.

As I entered his pulpit, I looked up at him, wondering why he wanted me to sing. He simply said, &#x201c;Sing for me the song you sing in Sunday school.&#x201d; I was only six years old, and this would be the first time I would sing in front of a large congregation of people. Grandpa could see that I was a bundle of nerves and leaned down to whisper, &#x201c;Remember, if you can think it, you can do it.&#x201d;<br> <br>He then stacked a few books beside the pulpit for me to stand on, so everybody could see me. I closed my eyes as tight as I could, said a quick prayer, and then started to sing:<br> <br><i>Jesus loves me, this I know</i>,<br> <br><i>For the Bible tells me so</i>.<br> <br><i>Little ones to Him belong</i>,<br><br><i>They are weak, but He is strong</i>.<br> <br><i>Yes, Jesus loves me!</i><br> <br><i>The Bible tells me so</i>.<br> <br>Midway through, I found the courage to open one eye a little bit. The people in the congregation were smiling and urging me on. They were shouting, &#x201c;Sing that song,&#x201d; &#x201c;Take your time,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Amen.&#x201d;<br> <br>Their encouragement seemed to wash over me, and I began to feel more confident. I closed my eyes again and really started to let loose. Even I was amazed at what was coming out of my little mouth and the notes I was able to hit. The moment was truly magical.<br> <br>When I finished, I opened my eyes and was amazed to see the entire congregation on their feet. I had received my first standing ovation.<br> <br>I DID IT then&#x2014;and after fifty years in show business, I&#x2019;m still doing it now.<br> <br>I was born Marie Dionne Warrick on December 12, 1940, and raised in East Orange, New Jersey, where my mommy, Lee Drinkard Warrick, my daddy, Mancel L. Warrick, my sister, Delia &#x201c;Dee Dee&#x201d; Warrick, and my brother, Mancel &#x201c;Pookie&#x201d; Warrick Jr., lived comfortably in a two-family home that we owned.<br> <br>I was named Marie after my mother&#x2019;s sister. My godmother, Dezbe, chose Dionne as my middle name. The only person ever to call me Marie was my gym teacher, Ms. Perry. That fact helped me to recognize her name when&#x2014;what seemed like a hundred years later&#x2014;she sent a note to me backstage at a performance in Florida. It was addressed to Marie. I was not only able to know that she was there, I announced her presence to the audience and told them that she calls me Marie and why. She looked exactly the same as I had remembered: she had the greatest haircut; it&#x2019;s called an Italian bob, and she still wears her silver-gray hair the exact same way, short and always neat.<br> <br>I was lucky to have good teachers and two wonderful parents who were brought up in God-fearing families and who raised their children in a similar fashion. I had what was considered a normal childhood at that time, in a neighborhood full of families much like mine, with a mother and father who gave us love and discipline in major proportions.<br> <br>My father&#x2019;s father was a minister&#x2014;he was also one of the wisest men ever to walk this earth, second only to Jesus, in my mind.<br> <br>Attending church was an important part of life for my mother&#x2019;s side of the family as well. That part of my family was full of gospel singers. Spending the entire day in church every Sunday was not exactly what we children ever wanted to do, but that&#x2019;s what happened. Our folks wouldn&#x2019;t have it any other way.<br> <br>My mother was a five-foot-four-inch bundle of energy, stylish, and, although soft-spoken, could put the fear of God in you with just a look. She worked at an electrical plant called Tung-Sol in Newark, New Jersey. She made filaments for lightbulbs, and I don&#x2019;t think she ever missed a day of work. I believe this taught us the worth of responsibility and the importance of earning your way through life. This was especially significant given there were not many role models for women who aspired to careers and work of their own at that time. The word I most associate with my mother is <i>class</i>. This captures the image of her that Dee Dee and I both kept of her and followed.<br> <br>Mommy expressed the importance of being a &#x201c;lady&#x201d; at all times in the ways we dressed, walked, spoke, and presented ourselves to the world. I sure hope that I have maintained the legacy she gave us.<br> <br>My daddy stood a full foot taller than my mom did. He was six foot four, lean, and gorgeous. He worked for the railroad as a Pullman porter, one of the best jobs available to African American men in his time. His legacy for us included an entrepreneurial spirit and vocal ability as well. He had a wonderful voice. When he retired from the railroad, he decided to become a certified public accountant. He took a correspondence course that earned him certification. As a consequence, he became my personal accountant. He also had a career after retirement as a butcher, a candy store owner, and, finally, a gospel record promoter for Hob Records. He also wrote a book, <i>The Progress of Gospel Music</i>, published by Vantage Press in 1977, and was on the road with me for a while as my road manager. So my daddy gave me that &#x201c;get up and go&#x201d; spirit. I was also a real daddy&#x2019;s girl.<br> <br>We lived at 46 Sterling Street in a large two-family house. We rented the first floor of our house to the Stewards, who were much like an extended part of our family. Frank and Henrine were parents like mine, who lovingly raised George, Frank Jr., Gwendolyn, and Bobby. We did practically everything together: went to the same schools, shared birthday celebrations and arguments. Gwen and I took piano lessons together every Wednesday after school from Mrs. Giggetts, the organist at my grandfather&#x2019;s church, and we became quite good. Gwen and I even performed at piano recitals that made Mrs. Giggetts, our parents, and our neighbors proud. Gwen was older than I was; however, she was my best friend.<br> <br>After my brother, Pookie, was born, we moved right next door, to 44 Sterling. Our new home was a bit larger, with five bedrooms, three bathrooms, a living room, a dining room, and a bigger kitchen. Dee Dee and I had our own bedrooms, so we had privacy&#x2014;as if we needed it. The only other differences were that we now had a large porch area and a large lawn in front of the house. We also had a German shepherd named Sonny Boy. Our lives there were full of happy, fun-filled times.<br> <br>Because I could hit a baseball, catch a football, play basketball, shoot marbles, and play street hockey as well as most of the boys on Sterling Street, I was considered a tomboy, but I was also very prissy. I loved wearing frilly dresses, jumping rope, having my hair curled, and playing with makeup like any other little girl. I had the best of both worlds rolled into one little body.<br> <br>Our neighborhood resembled the United Nations. Every race, color, creed, and religion lived on our block. Every parent knew one another, and the friendships I made then are still a very important part of my life. We walked to school together and had sleepovers at each other&#x2019;s homes. We played all kinds of games, including jacks and double Dutch jump rope. Some were games of skill and others were educational, such as Scrabble, spelling bees, and our version of what is now known as <i>Jeopardy!</i> We all went to a park called &#x201c;the Oval,&#x201d; where baseball, tennis, track meets, and other sporting events were held and taught by caring adults.<br> <br>One of the most important things our family did was to sit down together for dinner. We had wonderful conversations at the dinner table about a variety of topics, including show business.<br> <br>As I look back, I had a wonderful family life that got even better when my aunt Cissy came to live with us after my grandfather (my mother&#x2019;s father) passed. Though Cissy, whose real first name is Emily, is my mother&#x2019;s younger sister, she is only seven years older than I am. So while she was technically our aunt, she became like our big sister and lived with us until she got married. Aunt Cissy would later give birth to a little girl who would become one of the great voices of our time, my cousin Whitney Houston.<br> <br>My mom and her sisters, Cissy, Marie (&#x201c;Rebie&#x201d;), and Annie, and her brothers, Nick and Larry, all had great voices and at the time performed as the Drinkard Jubilairs. They would later become the Drinkard Singers. They held rehearsals in our living room, and since they could be heard up and down Sterling Street, the entire neighborhood got to share these wonderful times&#x2014;and their singing.<br> <br>The Drinkard Singers were a fabulous family gospel group, and Mommy was one of its founding members. They made quite a name for themselves and were part of the cavalcade of gospel groups that regularly toured the country. My maternal grandfather, Nitch Drinkard, was one of the keys to the group&#x2019;s success. He considered gospel singing a ministry and the Drinkard Singers a way to spread the message of Jesus Christ to the masses.<br> <br>They had begun singing down in Savannah, Georgia, where they lived in the late 1930s. The family, like so many other African Americans, eventually moved north. Cissy joined them when she was just a young thing, probably around five or six years old. Mommy became the group&#x2019;s manager, in addition to her work at Tung-Sol. Every now and then, I would sing with them.<br> <br>In 1951 they were one of the first groups to accompany the great Mahalia Jackson at a groundbreaking concert at Carnegie Hall, and in 1957 they, along with Mahalia and a few other gospel groups, including Clara Ward and the Ward Singers, performed at George Wein&#x2019;s Newport Jazz Festival. That was the first time the festival featured gospel music. The performance was recorded and became a live album, <i>The Drinkard Singers and the Back Home Choir at Newport</i>. The Drinkard Singers were so successful at Newport that RCA Records signed them, making them the first gospel group signed by the label. <i>A Joyful Noise</i> was their first studio album, released in 1958.<br> <br>Our family practically expected that Dee Dee, Pookie, and I would follow in their footsteps. And that almost became a reality. Both Dee Dee and I enjoyed professional singing careers, but my brother, as it is said, &#x201c;couldn&#x2019;t hold a tune in a paper bag.&#x201d; No, Pookie could not sing, nor did he want to. He had other things on his mind. He became an excellent baseball player, scouted by former Brooklyn Dodger Big Don &#x201c;Newk&#x201d; Newcombe, one of the first African American pitchers in the major leagues and a friend of my father. Pookie pleased my parents otherwise by becoming the first to marry and present them with their first grandchild, Barrance D. Warrick. Barry grew up to be quite a sound engineer. He started doing my sound in live performances and then on the road with Burt Bacharach, subsequently doing sound for various TV shows including <i>American Idol, Jimmy Kimmel Live!</i>, the Grammy Awards, and <i>Late Night with Conan O&#x2019;Brien</i>. I know that his dad, who made his transition following an automobile accident in 1968, would be busting buttons with pride just as his mother, fortunately, continues to do.<br> <br>The encouragement my parents, grandparents, and all in our church gave me that first time I sang before an audience gave me the formula that I have used to support and push my own family. I have raised them to believe that their dreams can become a reality. I say to them what my grandfather said to me: &#x201c;If you can think it, you can do it.&#x201d; I try to practice it in my daily life even today.<br> <br>When I was growing up in the late 1940s and early 1950s, African American youngsters didn&#x2019;t have a whole lot of options when it came to jobs and formal education. In those days, it was a huge achievement for any family, especially an African American family, to send a son or daughter off to college.<br> <br>Back in East Orange, we learned that if you worked hard in school, you could achieve your goals and make your dreams come true. Our intelligence and ambition were encouraged by our family and community. Consequently, many of us went on to college. And when we graduated, we were doctors, lawyers, teachers, scientists, government employees, professors, actors and actresses, and entertainers.<br> <br>My education started at the Lincoln Grammar School, now renamed the Dionne Warwick Institute of Economics and Entrepre-neurship; continued at the Vernon L. Davey Junior High School, now the Cecily Tyson Performing Arts School; and at the East Orange High School, all in East Orange. I went on to the Hartt College of Music in West Hartford, Connecticut, where I earned my bachelor&#x2019;s degree in music education and later returned for my master&#x2019;s degree in music.<br> <br>During my early school years, I was inspired by many of my teachers. One who remains vividly in my mind is my third-grade teacher, Mrs. Daniels, because she made me understand the meaning of the word <i>can</i>.<br> <br>In class one day, I repeatedly said, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t do this.&#x201d; As a consequence, she asked me to come to the front of the class and had me write a word on the blackboard. She asked me to write the word <i>American</i> in this manner: &#x201c;AMER&#x2014;I&#x2014;CAN.&#x201d; She asked me what the word was, and I answered, and then she asked me to pronounce the word as it was written. I did. And then she asked if I saw an apostrophe or a <i>t</i> anywhere in what I had written. Of course I answered no, and it became clear to me the I-CAN part of the word was what she wanted me to understand. The word <i>can&#x2019;t</i> to this very day does not exist in any part of my vocabulary, and I have passed this on to my children and grandchildren. And they all understand that &#x201c;I can&#x201d; is the phrase they should live by. And now I am passing that on to you.<br> <br>A multitude of friends and family made growing up pretty easy for me. In fact, the first rough spot I recall hitting was when I developed a crush on a guy named Virgil.<br> <br>First of all, Virgil was considered an older young man&#x2014;all of eighteen. I was fourteen at the time. The reaction of my friends and my parents meant that I had to be content to &#x201c;moon&#x201d; over Virgil from afar. He never knew any different.<br> <br>I was seventeen when I had my first real boyfriend, Jackie Martin, with whom I became engaged while he was in the service. I just knew he was my true love; that is, until I met Bill Elliott.<br> <br>During my high school years, I was a candy striper, a member of the gospel chorus and the glee club, and had the distinguished pleasure of being chosen to sing in the prestigious New Jersey All-State Choir, a group that anyone who thought they could hold a tune wanted to join.<br> <br>Auditions were competitive and the elimination process grueling. All this made receiving that letter of acceptance all the more joyous for my family and me. The choir performed a concert in Atlantic City. We were seniors in high school staying in a hotel on our own for the first time. We shared rooms, of course, and were supervised&#x2014;but we felt like adults. The experience, including the concert, was glorious and will always be one of the highlights of my life.<br> <br>SINGING WASN&#x2019;T the only vision I had for my future. Remembering what Grandpa had said to me, I wanted to be many things. I aspired to be a ballerina. I loved their dignity and grace, some of which I try to convey in my stage show. I thought of being a court stenographer&#x2014;I was always curious and perhaps a little nosy as a child. The thought of being a teacher became the most interesting to me, and I still feel I can share with others some of what I have learned.

Now comes Rich&#x2019;s rollicking debut novel, which explores the strangest, most twisted, and comically fraught terrain of them all: high school.<br><br>Seymour Herson is the least popular student at Glendale, a private school in Manhattan. He&#x2019;s painfully shy, physically inept, and his new nick-name, &#x201c;chunk style,&#x201d; is in danger of entering common usage. But Seymour&#x2019;s solitary existence comes to a swift end when he meets the new transfer student: Elliot Allagash, evil heir of America&#x2019;s largest fortune.<br><br>Elliot&#x2019;s rampant delinquency has already gotten him expelled from dozens of prep schools around the country. But despite his best efforts, he can&#x2019;t get himself thrown out of Glendale; his father has simply donated too much money. Bitter and bored, Elliot decides to amuse himself by taking up a challenging and expensive new hobby: transforming Seymour into the most popular student in the school.<br><br>An unlikely friendship develops between the two loners as Elliot introduces Seymour to new concepts, like power, sabotage, and vengeance. With Elliot as his diabolical strategist and investor, Seymour scores a spot on the basketball team, becomes class president, and ruthlessly destroys his enemies. Yet despite&nbsp;the glow of newfound popularity, Seymour feels increasingly uneasy with Elliot&#x2019;s wily designs. For an Allagash victory is dishonorable at its best, and ruinous at its worst.<br><br>Cunningly playful and wickedly funny,<b> Elliot Allagash</b> is a tale about all of the incredible things that money can buy, and the one or two things that it can&#x2019;t.</p><p><strong>Seth Meyers Reviews <em>Elliott Allagash</em></strong> <p><b>Seth Meyers is completing his ninth season on <i>Saturday Night Live</i>, his fourth season as head writer, and his fourth season as anchor of "Weekend Update." Meyers heads a writing staff that has won three Writer's Guild Awards as well as a Peabody for the show's 2008 election coverage. Read his review of <em>Elliot Allagash</em>:</b></p> <p></p> <p>We hired Simon Rich at <i>SNL</i> because of his amazing short fiction. When he told us he was writing a novel we made it clear that were it not up to his previous high standard we would have no choice but to terminate his employment. Well, I just finished <em>Elliot Allagash</em> and I&#x2019;m happy to say, he still has his job.</p> <p><em>Elliot Allagash</em> takes place in eighth grade and this is great news for anyone familiar with Simon&#x2019;s writing. Every comedy writer I know went through eighth grade but none render the details of it quite like Simon. Familiar schoolyard archetypes from nerds to bullies to hot girls all appear but they&#x2019;re sharper than ever.</p> <p>And it would be enough if Simon just spent his book examining the status ladder of Glendale Academy but fortunately there is so much more. Because the title character, <em>Elliot Allagash</em> is one of the best villains I&#x2019;ve ever encountered in fiction. By age thirteen his offenses include "vandalism, truancy, unprovoked violence, drunkenness, hiring an imposter to take a standardized test, and blackmail." In a classic deal-with-the-devil arrangement Elliot offers to make Seymour, our hero, the most popular kid in the school with the simple condition that Seymour must do everything Elliot says. What makes this journey delightful is that Elliot is extremely rich.</p> <p>The details of Elliot&#x2019;s wealth are joyous to read and too numerous to count. My favorite--the Allagash family belongs to the Seven Circles Club, a club so exclusive that they denied George Washington&#x2019;s only son membership because "his father was a farmer."</p> <p>A lot of very successful adults I know still wish they could re-live high school as someone popular. Reading this hilarious morality tale about the cost of that popularity makes me happy that I went through my high school years as an outsider. And it makes me even happier that Simon Rich did.</p> <br>&nbsp;Simon Rich has written for <i>The New Yorker, GQ, Mad, The Harvard Lampoon</i> and other magazines.

If their values were only fractionally different, we would not exist: nor, in many cases, would matter have had a chance to form. If the numbers that govern our universe were elegant--1, say, or pi, or the Golden Mean--we would simply shrug and say that the universe was an elegant mathematical puzzle. But the numbers Martin Rees discusses are far from tidy. Was the universe "tweaked" or is it one of many universes, all run by slightly different, but equally messy, rules?<p> This is familiar ground, though rarely so comprehensively explored. What makes Rees's book exceptional is his conviction that cosmology is as materialistic and as conceptually simple as any of the earth sciences. Indeed, </p><blockquote>cosmology is simpler in one important respect: once the starting point is specified, the outcome is in broad terms predictable. All large patches of the universe that start off the same way end up statistically similar. In contrast, if the Earth's history were re-run, it could end up with a quite different biosphere.</blockquote><p> Rees demonstrates how the cosmos is full of "fossils" from which we can deduce how our universe developed as surely as we infer the earth's past from the relics found in sedimentary rocks. Rees's theme is nothing less than the colossal richness of the universe. It is an ambitious book, but if anything, it deserves to be longer. <i>--Simon Ings, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><b>Matrin Rees</b> is a leading researcher on cosmic evolution, black holes, and galaxies.

In addition to her book, Avila also wrote poetry, plays, and gave lectures throughout the United States.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Joy Parker </b>is the coauthor of several books including<b> </b><i>Woman Who Glows in the Dark: A Curandera Reveals Traditional Aztec Secrets of Physical and Spiritual Health</i>, <i>Maya Cosmos: Three Thousand Years on the Shaman&#x2019;s Path</i>, and <i>The Sound of the Earth: A Man&#x2019;s Mid-Life Passage and Spiritual Awakening.<b> </b></i><br><br><b>Clarissa Pinkola Estes </b>is a poet, trauma specialist, and Jungian psychoanalyst most recognized as the author of <i>Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype</i>. She is also a spoken word performer and has performed with Maya Angelou and Toni Morrison.In the border towns of south Texas, the Mexican "folk" medicine called curanderismo is often regarded as witchcraftAa means for hex removals and love divinations. Avila was therefore surprised to learn in her masters program in psychiatric nursing at the University of Texas that curanderismo is a broad-based fusion of Aztec, Spanish and African traditional medicines with hundreds of useful applications. This discovery, coupled with her dissatisfaction with the limitations of conventional mental health practices, motivated Avila, who grew up in a first-generation Chicano family in El Paso, Tex., to apprentice with an Aztec master and eventually to become a full-time curandera. Her first book, co-written with Parker (coauthor of Maya Cosmos), is a clear-sighted introduction to the fundamentals of this alternative healing practice. It describes the healers, who range from spiritual counselors to general practitioners and massage therapists; their counseling techniques, ritual purifications and soul retrievals; characteristics of common diseases; and formulas for achieving a balanced lifestyle, a rich spiritual life and good nutrition. The down-to-earth explanations of such afflictions as envidia (envy), susto (fright or loss of soul) and mal puesto (bad luck) will help dispel misconceptions about these "folk" ailments that, in curandero terms, are common to all people. Particularly thought-provoking is Avila's perspective on mainstream mental health and her preference for the holistic curandero approach to treating mental diseases, including psychosis and imbalances induced by severe trauma. "A good curandera," she writes, "can help us find the middle ground in a culture where balance, reality, and enlightened compromise are not always part of our support system."

An ancient Zen story symbolizes the search for the source of life. Zen master Kakuan&#x2019;s story of <i>The Ten Bulls of Zen</i> is a teaching that uses ten images, each representing a particular step on the journey of experiencing and understanding what it means to be a conscious and aware human being. Osho takes readers through this story, and its lessons for the traveler, on a journey into the inner world the space for meditation. But reaching the pure, uncluttered freedom of meditation is not the end of the journey. The circle is only complete when the seeker comes back into the marketplace of the world, but as a transformed person. The book is illustrated with ten original images of Gomizen&#x2019;s Ten Bulls of Zen.</p><p><b>Osho</b> (1931&#x2013;1990) was a contemporary mystic whose life and teachings have influenced millions of people of all ages, and from all walks of life.

He is known around the world for his revolutionary contribution to meditation &#x2014; the science of inner transformation &#x2014; with the unique approach of his "OSHO Active Meditations" acknowledging the accelerated pace of contemporary life and bringing meditation into modern life. <b>Osho International Foundation</b> is based in Zurich, Switzerland.</p><h2>Peter and the Wolf</h2><p>An adaptation of the musical tale, accompanied by color illustrations of plucky Peter, the little bird, the slinky cat, and the wolf</p><p>European comics artist Miguelanxo Prado describes his two life passions as "listening to and inventing stores, as well as painting." In this adaptation of the classic folk tale by Sergei Prokofiev, Prado combines these passions into a glorious work of art. The soft, shadowy colors give this redition of <i>Peter and the Wolf</i> the look of something from another time and place. The book begins with two full-page paintings. The first is Peter, the duck, the cat, and the bird staring into the dark woods; the point of view is from behind them, with the reader staring into the woods with them. Turn the page and you'll see the same scene from the opposite point of view, from within the woods, looking out at them. The depiction is powerfully stirring, and as Prado himself says in his introduction: "While folk tales are usually meant for children, they nonetheless possess a fascinating, evocative power for adults." Whether <i>Peter and the Wolf</i> is for you or your child, Prado's version is a great addition to your bookshelf.A series of 112 dramatic picture frames illuminate the story of how Peter and his friends, each represented by a different musical instrument, outsmart the Wolf and then lead a triumphant procession back to Peter's cottage.&nbsp;&nbsp;The accompanying 25-minute audio cassette features eloquent narration and Prokofiev's splendid music.&nbsp;&nbsp;Praised by <i>School Library Journal</i> for its richness and full characterizations, this handsome package makes a classic gift for any child.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Old House Eco Handbook: A Practical Guide to Retrofitting for Energy Efficiency and Sustainability</h2><p><b>How should we go about making old houses energy efficient without devaluing future sustainability or the appeal and character of old homes by the use of inappropriate solutions?</b><br><br> This practical and essential guide&nbsp;to retrofitting for energy efficiency seeks to provide answers to this and other the questions homeowners of old houses are asking.

But on their first night in the city, a harem girl is found murdered&#x2014;strangled in the courtyard of the Sultan&#x2019;s lavish Topkapi Palace. Sir Richard St. Clare, an Englishman who works at the embassy in Constantinople, is present and recognizes the girl as his own daughter who was kidnapped twenty years earlier. Emily and Colin promise the heartbroken father they&#x2019;ll find her killer. <p></p>As a woman, Emily is given access to the forbidden world of the harem and quickly discovers that its mysterious, sheltered walls offer no protection from a ruthless murderer. Soon, the Valide (mother to the Sultan) is found strangled with a silken bowstring and the head Eunuch is brutally slain. <p></p>When the killer strikes again, kidnapping a concubine and threatening to kill her unless Emily agrees to meet him in secret, she cannot wait for Colin or the authorities to come to her rescue. In a heart-stopping finale, Emily must rely on her own sharp wits if she is to stop a killer bent on taking revenge no matter how many innocent lives he leaves in his wake.</p><p>When I first started working on the ideas for <i>Tears of Pearl</i>, I had expected there would be strict limits to what I could have Emily do in Constantinople. Like most contemporary Americans, I assumed women--particularly Western European women--wouldn't be able to move effortlessly through the city, wouldn't have any access to the sultan or the harem. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, whose husband was the British ambassador to the Ottomans in the early 18th century, wrote a series of letters that radically opened my mind. She visited with the sultan, bathed with his concubines (and revealed that the Turkish baths were not, in fact, lascivious and degenerate), and became familiar with the city and its culture. Her letters were greatly influential to subsequent English women travelers, who followed her example and explored the Ottoman capital with abandon over the next two centuries. In the 19th century, Lady Layard, another British ambassador's wife, became close friends with the sultan, dining with him and his family, watching him play with his children in the harem, and making frequent visits to the palace. As accuracy is of vital importance to me, I was thrilled to see there was historical precedent that made it possible for me to send Emily into these places without having to stretch credulity.The daughter of two philosophy professors, I grew up surrounded by books. I was convinced from an early age that I was born in the wrong century and spent much of my childhood under the dining room table pretending it was a covered wagon. Even there, I was never without a book in hand and loved reading and history more than anything. I studied English Literature and Medieval History at the University of Notre Dame. Writing is a natural offshoot of reading, and my first novel,&nbsp;<i>And Only to Deceive</i>, was published in 2005.

Sheen</h2><p>Among Fulton J. Sheen&#39;s thousands of converts were celebrities such as Clare Booth Luce and Henry Ford II, and former communists Louis Budenz and Elizabeth Bentley. Reeves discusses these conversions and Sheen&#39;s close friendship with J.

Sheen, perhaps the most important American priest of the 20th century. Sheen was an enormously popular figure in his day, hosting radio and television programs that introduced and explained his faith to millions of listeners and viewers. (He even won an Emmy Award, and the actor Martin Sheen took his stage name from the man.) Thomas C. Reeves, author of the JFK biography <i>A Question of Character</i>, offers an absorbing account of Sheen's life and times. He uncovers fascinating details, including a phony academic degree and the particulars of a bitter dogfight with Francis Cardinal Spellman. Although this is not a hagiographic account, it is an admiring one: Sheen comes across as an astoundingly smart, charismatic, and generous man. No wonder he was such a successful evangelizer: he converted thousands, including Henry Ford II and Claire Booth Luce. He gained some notoriety for his strong anticommunism; reading <i>America's Bishop</i>, in fact, provides a concise history of Catholic anticommunism in the United States. It is an outstanding book that will appeal to fans of George Weigel's <i>Witness to Hope: The Biography of Pope John Paul II</i> and anybody else attracted to this fascinating figure. <i>--John Miller</i>Thomas C.

To commemorate the 40th anniversary of their beginning, with Master and Commander, these evocative stories are being re-issued in paperback with smart new livery. This is the eighteenth book in the series. The Yellow Admiral -- the eighteenth novel in the sequence hailed as the greatest series of historical novels ever written -- sets the fall and rise of Jack Aubrey in brilliant counterpoint to the fall and rise of Napoleon Bonaparte. Life ashore may once again be the undoing of Jack Aubrey. Even Jack&#39;s exploits at sea turn sour in the storm waters off Brest. Worst of all, in the spring of 1814 peace breaks out. But Stephen Maturin returns from a mission in France with news that the Chileans require the service of English officers. Jack is savouring this reprieve for his career when he receives an urgent despatch ordering him to Gibraltar: Napoleon has escaped from Elba.</p><p>At last! Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin are back as Patrick O'Brian provides his indomitably loyal fans with another adventure, this one by land as well as by sea. Lucky Jack Aubrey finds himself not so lucky as his troubles amount ashore, his prospects of admiralty dimmed and Sophie's affection waning. At sea, he fares little better: in the storms off Brest he captures a French privateer ladden with gold and ivory at the expense of missing a signal and deserting his post. And worst of all, in the spring of 1814, peace breaks out... <p> Fortunately, Maturin returns from a mission in Chile with news that may help restore Aubrey to good favor with both his beloved navy and wife. Then, off to Gibraltar: Napoleon has escaped from Elba. </p><p> <b>The Yellow Admiral</b> is a change of pace, a reversion to the themes of the earlier novels in the Aubrey/Maturin series. Much of the story takes place on land, giving scope to O'Brian's fascination with the landscape, physical and social, of early nineteenth-century England. In vivid glimpses of various rural pursuits, and nuanced observation of politics and domestic arrangements, O'Brian proves himself ever more surely to be the heir of Jane Austen. Not to say there aren't some rousing and bloody sea-battles!</p>Life ashore may once again be the undoing of Jack Aubrey in Patrick O&#39;Brian&#39;s long-awaited sequel to his bestseller The Commodore. Aubrey, now a considerable though impoverished landowner, has dimmed his prospects at the admiralty by his erratic voting as a member of Parliament; he is feuding with his neighbor, a man with strong navy connections who wants to enclose the common land between their estates; he is on even worse terms with his wife, Sophie, whose mother has ferreted out a most damaging trove of old personal letters. Even Jack&#39;s exploits at sea turn sour: In the storm waters off Brest he captures a French privateer laden with gold and ivory, but this at the expense of missing a signal and deserting his post. Worst of all, in the spring of 1814, peace breaks out, and this feeds into Jack&#39;s private fear about his career: the prospect of being &#34;yellowed&#34;, or nominally promoted to the rank of admiral without any squadron to command. Fortunately, Jack is not left to his own devices.

The same can be said of Pomegranate's <i>Bungalow Basics</i> books. Each book in the series spotlights a different aspect of bungalows, those charming and efficient homes that came to epitomize the Arts and Crafts style in American residences. Douglas Keister's photographs capture the results of meticulous restorations, while Paul Duchscherer's text provides concise information about bungalow design and history. <p>Titles in the series: <i>Bathrooms, Bedrooms, Dining Rooms, Doors, Fireplaces, Kitchens, Living Rooms,</i> and <i>Porches.</i></p></p><p></p><h2>Gregory Crewdson</h2><p>Gregory Crewdson's photographic series capture a particularly American state of normalcy--in dissolution. The viewer, at first seduced by what appears to be an idyllic scene, soon discovers subtle off-kilter elements more akin to Film Noir than an NBC comedy. In a work from his <i>Twilight</i> series, yellow school buses are parked outside white wooden houses, and students stand and lounge around in seeming passivity. Something is happening--what, we don't know. The vision is familiar yet unfamiliar, seemingly benign yet threatening. Crewdson goes to great lengths in dramatizing his disturbing suburban scenes, employing elaborate lighting, cranes, props and extras, espousing a level of behind-the-scenes preparation more akin to the making of a Hollywood movie than the making of a still image. Here perhaps is one place to locate the eerie unreality and narrativity of his pictures, the creepy attention to detail so out of place, in the ordinary settings he evokes. Middle-class reality meets the other side of the normal here--by way of Sigmund Freud.</p><p></p><h2>A Garden of Latin Verse: Poems of Ancient Rome</h2><p>The poetry of Catullus, Virgil, Horace and Ovid has endured over 2,000 years. For most of that time it was read only in Latin, the language of its origin - but over the centuries celebrated writers, from John Dryden to Aubrey Beardsley to Ezra Pound, have been inspired to create their own translations. Each verse extract appears both in Latin and English, illustrated with a detail from an ancient Roman painting or mosaic - many of them treasures from Pompeii and Herculaneum, preserved by the volcanic eruption which destroyed the two cities in 79 AD. The images capture the spirit of the age in which this enchanting poetry was written and, accompanied by a biographical note on each poet, make a perfect introduction to the towering civilization that was Rome.</p><p></p><h2>Troubleshooting your handgun</h2><p>DO-IY-YOURSELF DIAGNOSIS AND REPAIR FOR PISTOLS AND REVOLVERS. 87 POPULAR PISTOLS AND REVOLVERS WITH HIGHLY DETAILED, ILLUSTRATED COVERAGE OF HOW TO FIX</p><p></p><h2>Humans</h2><p>We sell Rare, out-of-print, uncommon, &amp; used BOOKS, PRINTS, MAPS, DOCUMENTS, AND EPHEMERA.

In Silver Spring, Maryland, where she lives with her husband, daughter, and cat, she practices yoga and continues to dance. Celeste has also recorded for Blackstone Audio under the name C. M.

Nineteen-year-old Cornelia Otis Skinner and twenty-one-year-old Emily Kimbrough set out on the adventure of a lifetime, first on the high seas and then in England. From ships running aground, to hiding a case of the measles to avoid quarantine, to unwittingly taking lodgings in a brothel, the young women experience one madcap adventure after another. Without excessive ingenuousness, Lawson keeps her reading on an even keel, allowing clever dialogue, comical situations, and witty repartee to carry the story forward. Nostalgia for a time when the most expensive item on a chic restaurant's menu was $2.95 will keep listeners engaged.

In this, the last decade of her life, Woolf wrote distinguished literary essays on Turgenev, Goldsmith, Congreve, Gibbon and Horace Walpole. In addition, there are a number of more political essays, such as &#39;Why Art To-Day Follows Politics&#39;, &#39;Women Must Weep&#39; (a cut-down version of Three Guineas and never before reprinted), &#39;Royalty&#39; (rejected by Picture Post in 1939 as &#39;an attack on the Royal family, and on the institution of kingship in this country&#39;), &#39;Thoughts on Peace in an Air Raid&#39;, and even &#39;America, which I Have Never Seen...&#39; (&#39;[&#39;Americans are] the most interesting people in the world - they face the future, not the past&#39;). In &#39;The Leaning Tower&#39; (1940), Virginia Woolf faced the future and looked forward to a more democratic post-war age: &#39;will there be no more towers and no more classes and shall we stand, without hedges between us, on the common ground&#39; Woolf stimulates her readers to think for themselves, so she &#39;never forges manifestos, issues guidelines, or gives instructions that must be followed to the letter&#39; (Maria DiBattista).In providing an authoritative text, introduction and annotations to Virginia Woolf&#39;s essays, Stuart N. Clarke has prepared a common ground - for students, common readers and scholars alike - so that all can come to Woolf without specialised knowledge.</p><p></p><h2>Even More Short &amp; Shivery: Thirty Spine-Tingling Tales</h2><p>Thirty spine-chilling stories from around the world provide plenty of shivers in this spooky collection.&nbsp;&nbsp;Curl up with old friends like Washington Irving's "Guests from Gibbet Island" or Charles Dickens' "Chips."&nbsp;&nbsp;Or make the aquaintance of "The Skull That Spoke" and "The Monster of Baylock"--but beware of spectral visitors like "The Blood-Drawing Ghost."

England after the war was a different place; the arts were different; history was different; sex, society, class were all different.Samuel Hynes examines the process of that transformation. He explores a vast cultural mosaic comprising novels and poetry, music and theatre, journalism, paintings, films, parliamentary debates, public monuments, sartorial fashions, personal diaries and letters.Told in rich detail, this penetrating account shatters much of the received wisdom about the First World War. It shows how English culture adapted itself to the needs of killing, how our stereotypes of the war gradually took shape and how the nations thought and imagination were profoundly and irretrievably changed.</p><p>Samuel Hynes is Woodrow Wilson Professor of Literature as Princeton University. Together with his earlier works- The Edwardian Turn of Mind and The Auden Generation- A War Imagined forms an important continuous study of the relationship between literature, the arts and th4e events of history during the first four decades of the twentieth century.Continuing the ground-breaking work of Paul Fussell in The Great War and Modern Memory, Hynes (Flights of Passage, 1988, etc.; Literature/Princeton) looks into the origin and impact of the myth that came into being to explain the significance of WW I. That myth depicted an idyllic England shattered irrevocably by the onslaught of a cruel and unnecessary way, by a generation of brave and idealistic young men lost in trench warfare prolonged by stupid generals and unimaginative politicians, and by the subsequent rejection by the embittered survivors of the values of their society. Hynes, like Fussell, uses major literary works of the period to illustrate the origin and growth of the myth, but also draws on newspapers and magazines, art, music, political debates, films, diaries, and letters. In certain respects, he casts doubt on the truth of the myth: The prewar period, for example, was characterized by labor unrest, Suffragette violence, the threat of civil war in Ireland, and a growing violence in the tone of political discourse. Hynes suggests, too, the difficulty of summarizing complex phenomena in so facile a way: There is, he notes, the picturesque popular image of way, which is clear and easy to respond to, and there is the truth, which is inconsistent, contradictory, and threatening. Thus, for example, the early poetry of Rupert Brooke, full of ideals and of the glory of sacrificing one's life for one's country, continued to be popular with some of the supposedly embittered young men late in the war. Ultimately, Hynes implies, these quibbles are almost irrelevant to shake a myth that has profoundly affected the way war is viewed in the 20th century. More suggestive than conclusive in its analysis of the validity of the myth, Hynes's account of the impact of a terrible war is still rich and satisfying.

It is then, at the young and vulnerable age of seventeen, when Lady Anna Maria Berezowska loses both of her parents and must leave the only home she has ever known.<br><br>With Empress Catherine's Russian armies streaming in to take their spoils, Anna is quickly thrust into a world of love and hate, loyalty and deceit, patriotism and treason, life and death.

Heeding the proud spirit of her late father, Anna becomes a major player in the fight against the countries who come to partion her beloved Poland.<br><br><i>Push Not the River</i> is based on the true eighteenth century diary of Anna Maria Berezowska, a Polish countess who lived through the rise and fall of the historic Third of May Constitution. Vivid, romantic, and thrillingly paced, it paints the emotional and unforgettable story of the metamorphosis of a nation--and of a proud and resilient young woman.<br></p><p>The cornerstone of this novel is the unpublished diary of Countess Anna Maria Berezowska, who began keeping it when her personal world began to disintegrate and her writing became for her, I suspect, a great therapy. She sometimes read and copied into her own diary colorful entries from her cousin Zofia's diary. It was Zofia's often risque narrative that most likely accounted for subsequent generations' witholding the document from the public. For some decades it was even sealed in wax and hidden away. <p>Amazingly,the years of the countess' personal crises coincided with some of the most important years in all of Polish history: the Third of May Constitution years. It is fortunate that such a remarkable private view--and a woman's view--of those perilous years has survived.</p>"<i>Push Not the River</i> contains all the sweep and romance of the classic romantic epics such as <i>Gone with the Wind</i> and <i>Doctor Zhivago,</i> with a heroine who remains strong in the face of both personal and political tragedy.

Combining politics with intrigue and romance, <i>Push Not the River</i> gives us a glimpse into the turbulent era of late eighteenth century Poland and its people. Aristocrats and peasants, patriots and traitors come alive in this story, and the Polish soul is beautifully illuminated through ancient myths, folkways, and wisdoms. With his juxtaposition of the personal and political, Martin weaves a compelling tale of transformation--both of a remarkable young woman and her remarkable nation."<br>-Jennifer Donnelly, author of <i>The Tea Rose</i><br> <br>"Martin's novel transports the reader two hundred years into Poland's glorious past, a world of castles and manor houses. One woman's life provides a metaphor for a country which--with the Third of May Constitution--was the first to attempt democratic reform in modern Europe.

Relying on his own letters home and recollections he penned just after his discharge, Webster gives a first hand account of life in <i>E Company, 101st Airborne Division</i>, crafting a memoir that resonates with the immediacy of a gripping novel. From the beaches of Normandy to the blood-dimmed battlefields of Holland, here are acts of courage and cowardice, moments of irritating boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror, and pitched urban warfare. Offering a remarkable snapshot of what it was like to enter Germany in the last days of World War II, Webster presents a vivid, varied cast of young paratroopers from all walks of life, and unforgettable glimpses of enemy soldiers and hapless civilians caught up in the melee. Parachute Infantry is at once harsh and moving, boisterous and tragic, and stands today as an unsurpassed chronicle of war�&#x20ac;&#x201d;how men fight it, survive it, and remember it.</p><p>An English literature major at Harvard with a talent for writing, twenty-one-year-old David Kenyon Webster volunteered for duty in the U.S. Army&#39;s parachute infantry in 1943 with the aim of seeing combat firsthand and then describing his experiences. His introduction to warfare came at the invasion of Normandy on D-Day in 1944. Webster went on to see considerable action in the next two years, serving as a combat infantryman in the campaign through northwest Europe, during which he was twice wounded. He wrote Parachute Infantry a short time after the war, relying on his letters home and recollections he penned right after his discharge, making his memoir much closer to the war than most such works. With its abundant dialogue, charged descriptions of places and events, and skillful evocation of emotions, Webster&#39;s narrative resonates with the immediacy of a gripping novel. The memoir is divided into several episodes. The first takes place in May and June of 1944 and provides a detailed, suspenseful account of Webster&#39;s participation in the events of D-Day. The next covers several days in September, 1944, when Webster parachuted into Holland and then as part of a group of soldiers advanced through small towns, freeing them as the Germans retreated, until he was shot in the leg and forced to leave his unit. The narrative then picks up in February, 1945, after Webster has returned to his unit, and describes several weeks near the end of the war in Europe, when German resistance was still strong but weakening. Then comes the Allied victory in 1945. We see Webster&#39;s platoon arriving at Berchtesgaden (Hitler&#39;s vacation retreat in the Alps) right before V-E Day and the celebrations and laxdiscipline that followed the final collapse of the Third Reich. In the last section of the book, Webster recalls the monotonous routine of occupation duty, concluding with his return to the States in early 1946 to be discharged. Stephen E. Ambrose, director of the Eisenhower Center at the University of New Orleans, introduces Parachute Infantry, pointing out as two important strengths Webster&#39;s honesty and his ability to describe so well his fellow soldiers - men he never would have known or associated with in civilian life but with whom he developed the strongest bonds during his wartime experience. Parachute Infantry proves to be a riveting account of a young soldier&#39;s experience of war.David Kenyon Webster (1922-1961) was an aspiring writer who left Harvard to join the paratroops in World War II. After the war ended, he wrote about his experience as a paratrooper in Parachute Infantry. The manuscript for this book would later become source material for Stephen E. Ambrose's Band of Brothers. Webster's other works include Myth and Maneater.<br><br>Audie Award finalist Alan Sklar has narrated nearly two hundred audiobooks and has won several AudioFile Earphones Awards.</p><h2>A Commonplace Book of Cookery: A Collection of Proverbs, Anecdotes, Opinions and Obscure Facts on Food, Drink, Cooks, Cooking, Dining, Diners &amp; Dieters, dating from ancient times to the present</h2><p>Commonplace books, observes M.

The walls were made of heavy, thick logs, after all. The main living area was a broad space leaking from kitchen to dining area to a two-story-high lounge arranged around a tall, fieldstone fireplace. <br>Millie sat on one of the couches, staring out the windows, and frowned. It was snowing outside&#x2014;big, fat, fluffy flakes&#x2014;but she really wasn&#x2019;t noticing. <br>She was alone in the room and then she wasn&#x2019;t. <br>Davy was wearing a tropical-weight suit with the sleeves of the jacket rolled up on his forearms. He unrolled them as he asked, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; <br>Millie sighed, her eyes tracking up to the ceiling before returning to Davy&#x2019;s face. <br>Davy glanced up to the second-floor landing. &#x201c;The usual?&#x201d; <br>Millie jerked her thumb up. &#x201c;Go look at her door.&#x201d; <br>He sighed. &#x201c;She is an irritation of the spirit.&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>Millie completed the phrase, &#x201c;&#x2026; and a great deal of trouble.&#x201d; <br>Davy vanished. After a brief pause Millie heard laughter drift down the staircase. Millie stood and jumped, appearing beside Davy in the upstairs hallway. <br>A sign, scrawled on butcher paper, was tacked to a closed bedroom door. It said: <br>HELP! <br>BEING HELD PRISONER BY TELEPORTING ALIENS! <br>KEPT FROM NORMAL LIFE. <br>SEND FRIENDS. <br>ALSO ICE CREAM. <br>Davy was shaking his head and still laughing. <br>&#x201c;Stop it!&#x201d; Millie said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not helping!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You gotta admit, she <i>is</i> funny,&#x201d; Davy said. &#x201c;Takes after me that way.&#x201d; <br>Millie snapped. &#x201c;What&#x2014;you think <i>you&#x2019;re</i> funny?&#x201d; She pulled at Davy&#x2019;s arm, leading him back toward the landing. <br>Davy raised his eyebrows at Millie and grinned. <br>&#x201c;Okay, she <i>is</i> funny, but the underlying problem is no less a problem.&#x201d; <br>Davy&#x2019;s smile faded and he jerked his chin down toward the kitchen, and vanished. <br>Millie followed to see him putting the kettle on. <br>&#x201c;What choice do we have?&#x201d; Davy said. &#x201c;I mean, really?&#x201d; <br>Millie shook her head. She felt like she <i>should</i> have an answer but she didn&#x2019;t. <br>Davy hugged her and that was good&nbsp;&#x2026; but the underlying problem was still no less a problem. <br>And it could only get worse. <br> <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2012 by Steven Gould <br></p><h2>False Memory</h2><p>It's a fear more paralyzing than falling. More terrifying than absolute darkness. More horrifying than anything you can imagine. It's the one fear you cannot escape, no matter where you run...no matter where you hide. It's the fear of yourself. It's real. It can happen to you. And facing it can be deadly.<br><br>Fear for your mind.</p><p>Not a continuation of the <i>Moonlight Bay</i> series (<i>Seize the Night</i> and <i>Fear Nothing</i>) as many fans were expecting, <i>False Memory</i> is nonetheless just as powerful and compulsive as anything Koontz has written before.<p> Martie Rhodes is a successful young computer games designer with a loving husband, Dusty, and a seemingly normal life. Her best friend, Susan, however, suffers from agoraphobia, or a fear of open spaces, and relies on Martie to take her to weekly therapy sessions. Suddenly and inexplicably, Martie herself begins exhibiting worrying signs of a mental disorder, fearing herself capable of inflicting great harm on her loved ones. At the same time, Dusty's brother Skeet also succumbs to irrational mental behavior and tries to throw himself from a roof. It soon becomes clear that these four characters are involved in something much more than a sinister coincidence.</p><p> Koontz's great skill, as he demonstrates so well in this novel, is creating believable characters and thrusting them into seemingly impossible but--for the period of the story--completely plausible situations. The plot is as carefully layered as the most intricate orchestral compositions, and Koontz conducts the proceedings with almost unbearable tension. One of his greatest abilities as a writer, however, is tapping into the dark paranoia of society. As we approach the Millennium, and an age in which we are becoming increasingly desensitized to death and violence, Martie's fear of herself, known as autophobia, seems a terrifying warning that soon the only thing we will have left to fear is ourselves.</p><p> Deeper meanings aside, this is easily one of his best thrillers. The prose moves at a breakneck speed, and the denouement will leave you with a pounding heart and chills up and down your spine. Koontz delivers exciting, boundary-breaking fiction better than anyone else in the game, and <i>False Memory</i> (though at times shocking and disturbing) is a perfect example of a master author in top form. <i>--Jonathan Weir, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>"Viscerally exciting...an extended, tense tour de force...an expertly crafted, ornate suspenser...Koontz fans will love it."<br>-- Publishers Weekly (starred review)<br>Don't miss these novels by "America's most popular suspense novelist." *Dean Koontz<br><br>Seize The Night<br>Fear Nothing<br>Sole Survivor<br>Intensity<br>Dark Rivers Of The Heart<br>Icebound<br>Ticktock<br>Winter Moon<br>Available wherever Bantam Books are sold<br><br>And watch for <br>From The Corner Of His Eye<br><br>On sale December 26, 2000 in hardcover<br>*Rolling Stone<br></p><h2>The Memoirs of Frederic Mistral</h2><p>Fr�d�ric Mistral (1830-1914) was without a doubt the greatest modern Proven�al poet and the foremost champion of his native Provence, the guiding spirit of a group of latter-day troubadours who revived and refined the language of Southern France as a literary medium. For this achievement and for his own poetry, Mistral was awarded the Nobel prize in 1904&#x2013;&#x2013;characteristically, he gave the prize money to a folklore museum he had founded in Arles. Two years later, at the age of seventy-six, Mistral published his charming book of&nbsp;<em>Memoirs</em>, which is not so much an autobiography as a recollection of the life of ordinary country people in his early years, filled with delightful anecdotes, tales, folksongs, and poetry. Written in the relaxed conversational style of an elderly gentleman reminiscing about the old days, the&nbsp;<em>Memoirs</em>&nbsp;describe the circumstances of Mistral&#x2019;s childhood and early manhood &#x2013; the Proven�al landscapes, the seasonal life of the farm, the religious observances and seasonal festivities, many clearly of pagan origin. Although educated in the classics and law in Avignon and Aix, Mistral felt out of place among the French-speaking bourgeois and returned to his family farm to devote his life to writing for the simple farming people of his region. He soon began his long poem&nbsp;Mireio&nbsp;(eventually transformed into the opera Mireille by Gounod), whose heroine was modeled on the peasant girls he saw and worked with daily. At the same time, he and several other young men came together to form the Felibrige, a society dedicated to restoring the Proven�al language and preserving local traditions. The&nbsp;<em>Memoirs</em>&nbsp;concludes with the death of young Mistral&#x2019;s father and the success of Mireio (1859), so quietly understated that one would hardly suspect that the author had been hailed as a major poet while still in his twenties. Mistral wrote his&nbsp;<em>Memoirs</em>&nbsp;in Proven�al and himself translated them into French. A previous English translation (abridged and paraphrased from the French) was published in 1907 and has been out of print ever since. In his new translation, George Wickes of the University of Oregon has mined Mistral&#x2019;s monumental dictionary,&nbsp;<em>Lou Tresor d�u F�librige</em>. This illustrated edition includes the original texts of Proven�al songs and verse, with Professor Wickes&#x2019; English versions printed en face.</p><p>Written in the relaxed conversational style of an elderly gentlemen reminiscing about old days, the Memoirs describe the circumstances of mistral&#39;s childhood and early manhood--the Provencal landscapes, the seasonal life of the farm, the religious observances and seasonal festivities, many clearly of pagan origin.

It became a potential "roadblock" for the American Pacific Fleet in its advance towards the Japanese Empire. These islands were targeted twice by US Navy carrier striking forces with a powerful group of battleships, cruisers, and destroyers for support. Target objectives included the destruction of the shipping, aircraft, and installations. In addition, land-based US Army Air Force B-24s and B-29s carried out an extensive bombing campaign against the islands. The Japanese defenders were overwhelmed by the concentrated bombing, torpedo, rocket, and strafing attacks by the planes of the US Navy carrier forces and by the heavy pounding given them by land-based Army Air Force bombers. Huge rusting guns in the Japanese-built caves, pillboxes, open emplacements, and a lagoon filled with ship and aircraft wrecks are an important legacy from World War II in this tropical central Pacific island group. The sheer number and diversity of the wrecks found in the relatively shallow lagoon waters brings thousands of divers to this remote location every year. Truk, now known as Chuuk State, has become one of the most desirable dive locations in the world. <p>This 533-page volume documents the Japanese occupation and build-up of Truk into a strategic naval base, the air campaign against the ships, aircraft, and installations, and the exploration/descriptions of the ship and aircraft wrecks that remain. Many new details of the Operation Hailstone raids of February 17-18, 1944 and the Japanese reaction have been included from information found in intelligence file references. Emphasis on the aerial combat between the Japanese and American planes, descriptions of Japanese installations and defenses, and information on the intensive US fast carrier raids of April 29-30, 1944 against Truk have been published for the first time. A total of 173 maps and drawings, 101 black and white photos, and 150 color plates are included in this book.</p></p><p>The objective in writing this book was to make it one of the most detailed books ever written on the subject of World War II and the US campaign against one of the important Japanese bases in the Pacific War. The description of Truk island&#39;s history, its defenses and installations, and the ship and aircraft wrecks that are a legacy of the battles that took place are presented in more detail than has ever been attempted. New information is added throughout the book that has been gathered from exhaustive research.Dan Bailey was born in Redding, California, an inland area in the northern part of the state. He graduated from Brigham Young University with a degree in Electrical Engineering in 1966. He went to work for GTE Sylvania in 1969 as a radar systems engineer on Roi-Namur in the Kwajalein Atoll (Marshall Islands). Kwajalein is the receiving end of the ICBM test missiles fired from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. These missile tests were used to accumulate information on warhead accuracy and to build a database on characteristics of warheads entering the atmosphere that can be used to destroy enemy weapon systems. Kwajalein had been a Japanese World War II island naval base and many ships and aircraft had been sunk in the surrounding lagoon waters. There was an active diving community on Kwajalein and Roi-Namur and he soon became very involved in diving the wrecks. Shortly after the diving services opened up at Truk, he began traveling there regularly. <p>Dan began accumulating underwater photos from both Kwajalein and Truk and documenting the wrecks for a proposed book. In 1982, he published the first edition of "World War II Wrecks of the Kwajalein and Truk Lagoons." Three revised and updated editions and three other printings of the book resulted. Meanwhile, Dan's interest in wreck diving resulted in trips to Palau in the Western Caroline Islands. In 1991, the book "World War II Wrecks of Palau" was published. </p><p>"World War II Wrecks of the Truk Lagoon," finally published in February 2001, was the result of eight years of concentrated research, writing, the drawing of the maps and illustrations and the assembling of of information and photos gathered from some 41 (or 42?) diving trips to the Truk Lagoon since 1971. </p><p>Following two tours at Kwajalein, Dan worked in Europe for nine years on classified projects and then retired as an engineer in 1986. His time is now spent between managing real estate investments and North Valley Diver Publications business (promoting and selling diving books and maps) while living again in Redding, California.</p></p><h2>Less than Slaves (Harvard Paperbacks)</h2><p><p>As a United States war crimes investigator during World War II, Benhamin B. Ferencz participated in the liberation of Nazi concentration camps. He returned to Germany after the war to help bring perpetrators of war crimes to justice and remained to direct restitution programs for Nazi victims. In Less Than Slaves, Ferencz describes the painstaking efforts that were made to persuade German industrial firms such as I. G. Farben, Krupp, AEG, Rheinmetall, and Daimler-Benz to compensate camp inmates who were exploited as forced laborers. The meager outcome of these efforts emerges from searing pages that detail the difficulties confronted by Ferencz and his dedicated colleagues. This engrossing narrative is a vital resource for all who are concerned with the moral, legal, and practical implications of the recent significant increase in the number of compensation claims by victims of persecution. First published in 1979, Ferencz's penetrating firsthand account returns to print with the author's evaluation of its historical significance and current relevance.</p></p><p><p>Benjamin B. Ferencz was the prosecutor at the Nuremberg trial of the SS Einsatzgruppen. Now in his eighties, Ferencz remains active as a teacher, lecturer, and author of books on international law and articles dealing with the creation of an international criminal court.</p><p>"... this book tells the story of great courage and determination by survivors and their allies to try to compel German companies to make at least partial amends for the use of slave labor during the war. Yet it is also a story of an equally determined refusal to see that past honestly, to own up to it, and to voluntarily try to make it right. As such, whatever its limitations as a historical analysis, it will undoubtedly continue to serve as a valuable starting point for thinking about the efforts to make good again the harm done during the Third Reich. &#x2014;" &#x2014;net, April 2005</p> (net, April 2005)</p><h2>Stormtroopers: A New History of Hitler&#39;s Brownshirts</h2><p><b>The first full history of the Nazi Stormtroopers whose muscle brought Hitler to power, with revelations concerning their longevity and their contributions to the Holocaust</b><br><br> Germany&#x2019;s Stormtroopers engaged in a vicious siege of violence that propelled the National Socialists to power in the 1930s.

Muldoon gives not only a vivid account of his own astral projections, but instructions to the student in the technique of projecting the astral body.</p><p><p>John Magnus is a software engineer and e-commerce entrepreneur, inter-dimensional traveler, writer, and musician originating from Halmstad, Sweden. Since his birth in 1977, John lived a quiet and dull life until he one day discovered the discipline of astral projection. This event aroused a fierce desire to understand the out-of-body phenomenon, and in conjunction, to understand physical reality. John has undertaken countless investigative expeditions into the astral and the findings are presented in Astral Projection and The Nature of Reality. Because of the commonly hard-to-digest nature of the unknown, the book is designed to gently guide the reader toward his own astral discoveries, rather than merely disclose opinions. In order to spread the knowledge of astral projection, John gives workshops on related subjects.

Is Just Enough!</h2><p><i>Small-Batch Baking</i> is how to have your cake, and eat it all too. It's baking a plate of cookies (not 4 dozen) to greet the kids when they come home from school, or a few muffins (not 12) when that's all you need for Sunday brunch. It's for the perfect tart to end a small, romantic dinner--or the indulgence of a one-bowl dessert just for you (Honey Apple Oatmeal Crisp, anyone?). Most of all, it's to bring home the joy of baking, when home is just the two of you--small batches whip up quickly, clean up quickly, and don't require hours at the oven. <br><br>Written by Debby Maugans Nakos, who clearly possesses the Southern baking gene, <i>Small-Batch Baking</i> offers 200 irresistible recipes from across the baking spectrum: triple layer cakes, bundt cakes, angel food cakes; pies and tarts; cobblers, crisps, crumbles, and short cakes; cookies, bars, squares; biscuits, muffins, scones, breakfast breads; and a whole section just on Valentine Specials--Double Hot Chocolate Souffl�s, Ch�vre Cheesecakes with Honey Anise Ginger Syrup, Vanilla Banana Caramel Flan.<br><br>A batch of Cream-Filled Chocolate Cookies--that yields a half-dozen. A Coconut Layer Cake, just for two. Individual servings of Cinnamon French Toast Pudding or Southern Peach Cobbler with Bourbon Cream. It's all the bewitching pleasure of home-baked, but--finally--for just one or two.</p><p>Perfect for romantic occasions, small households, or just whipping up something for the kids when they come home from school, <i>Small-Batch Baking</i> delivers more than 225 smashing, small-yield recipes for all types of baking.Debby Maugans Nakos writes a monthly column for <i>Birmingham Magazine</i> and is former food editor of <i>Creative Ideas for Living</i> magazine. Her articles have also appeared in <i>Bon App�tit</i> and <i>Food &amp; Wine</i>, and she developed the recipes for Fannie Flagg's popular <i>Whistle Stop Caf� Cookbook</i>. She lives in Birmingham, Alabama, with her husband and two daughters, who draw straws to see who gets to taste test the small-batch recipes.</p><h2>Social Construction Of Reality</h2><p>A general and systematic account of the role of knowledge in society aimed to stimulate both critical discussion and empirical investigations. This book is concerned with the sociology of &#x2018;everything that passes for knowledge in society&#x2019;. It focuses particularly on that &#x2018;common-sense knowledge&#x2019; which constitutes the reality of everyday life for the ordinary member of society. The authors are concerned to present an analysis of knowledge in everyday life in the context of a theory of society as a dialectical process between objective and subjective reality. Their development of a theory of institutions, legitimations and socializations has implications beyond the discipline of sociology, and their &#x2018;humanistic&#x2019; approach has considerable relevance for other social scientists, historians, philosophers and anthropologists.</p><p>This book reformulates the sociological subdiscipline known as the sociology of knowledge. Knowledge is presented as more than ideology, including as well false consciousness, propaganda, science and art. "... A major breakthrough in the sociology of knowledge." -- <i>American Sociological Review</i>.This book reformulates the sociological subdiscipline known as the sociology of knowledge. Knowledge is presented as more than ideology, including as well false consciousness, propaganda, science and art.</p><h2>Folk Keeper</h2><p>Corinna is the keeper of the gate of the world below where all the fierce folk reside, yet knowing that she is not one of the evil people, she begins to ask questions about herself in this fantastical tale for middle readers.</p><p>She is never cold, she always knows exactly what time it is, and her hair grows two inches while she sleeps. Fifteen-year-old Corinna Stonewall--the only Folk Keeper in the city of Rhysbridge--sits hour after hour with the Folk in the dark, chilly cellar, "drawing off their anger as a lightning rod draws off lightning." The Folk are the fierce, wet-mouthed, cave-dwelling gremlins who sour milk, rot cabbage, and make farm animals sick. Still, they are no match for the steely, hard-hearted, vengeful orphan Corinna who prides herself in her job of feeding, distracting, and otherwise pacifying these furious, ravenous creatures. The Folk Keeper has power and independence, and that's the way she likes it. <p> One day, Corinna is summoned by Lord Merton to come to the vast seaside estate Cliffsend as Folk Keeper and family member--for she is the once-abandoned child he has been looking for. It is at Cliffsend that Corinna learns where her unusual powers come from, why she is drawn to the sea, and finally, what it means to be comfortable in her own skin. Written in the form of a journal, <i>The Folk Keeper</i> is a powerful story of a proud, ferociously self-reliant girl who breaks out of her dark, cold, narrow world into one of joy, understanding, and even the magic of romance. Franny Billingsley, author of the critically acclaimed fantasy <i>Well Wished</i>, has created a vividly portrayed, deliciously frightening novel that will have readers glued to the pages until the very un-bitter end. (Ages 10 and older) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p>Approx. 4 hours<br>3 cassettes<br><br>Orphan Corinna disguises herself as a boy to pose as a Folk Keeper, one who keeps the Evil Folk at Bay. She is summoned by the dying lord of a vast estate on Cliffsend, the largest of the Northern Isles, which has miles of underground caverns populated by wild, especially savage Folk. It is on Cliffsend that Corinna comes face to face with herself and the future she will need to choose.<br><br></p><h2>Best Quick Breads: 150 Recipes for Muffins, Scones, Shortcakes, Gingerbreads, Cornbreads, Coffeecakes, and More</h2><p>Take the 100 best recipes from the author&#39;s classic (but out-of-print) The Art of Quick Breads, stir in 50 scrumptiously brand-new creations, and you have enough terrific quick breads to last a lifetime.

Now all this wisdom has been distilled into a convenient Running Press Miniature Edition�&#x201e;� to help anyone master the art of organic gardening quickly and easily!</p><p>This hefty reference manual is absolutely packed with specific information on everything from bee-keeping to window gardening. More like a standard textbook than most gardening books of today, <i>Encyclopedia of Organic Gardening</i> has been around since 1959, and in its 1,000-plus pages manages to address everything from the nitrogen content of common items (feathers, eggshells, etc.) to choosing the most appropriate foundation planting for a formal entrance. The only illustrations are plain black and white, and fancy color photography is nonexistent. This lack is balanced by the healthy dose of charts and analytical lists shown throughout. Don't be scared by the seemingly technical presentation--this is a clearly written book that's easy to follow even for the novice gardener.<p> The answer to any possible gardening question is sure to be found here for both backyard green thumbs and those interested in heavy, possibly profitable, production of organic vegetables and herbs. Arranged alphabetically, you'll find multipage explanations of organic fertilizers next to a one-paragraph description of fenugreek. Most plants have multiple listings, as the authors tried to include many slang names of common flowers and grasses--no Latin necessary with this plant guide. Not meant to be a glossy coffee-table book, this encyclopedia is exactly what a reference book should be--serious, friendly, helpful, and thorough. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p>J.I.

In papers on abandonment, nostalgia, betrayal, schism, failure, and masturbation, Hillman shows that pathology belongs intrinsically to the psyche and that it reveals the unchanging, necessary, fecund depths of human nature. A brief note on story pleads for a &#39;story sense,&#39; a deeply therapeutic awareness of how mythic persons and archetypal events influence the psyche by conditioning perceptions, generating meanings, and shaping our lives, while another essay associates archetypal psychology with neoplatonism, the elegant, cultured, psychological vision of Plotinus, Ficino, and Vico. Together these twelve essays and talks affirm the polyvent, shadowed reality of the psyche and afford an example of subtle, nuanced psychological thought.

Each storyteller builds upon those who came before them, picking the parts they like best and adding their own bits and pieces to the story. This collection of short stories continues that tradition, starting with the traditional roots of Japanese folklore and retelling them for a modern audience. DC and Michael McGannon draw upon the "folk" nature of folklore by taking familiar stories and making them their own. Their tales stay true to the nature of the ghosts and monsters of old Japan, while adding a bit of their own personality into the mix. Diehard fans of Japanese folklore will recognize the original folktales at the heart of each of these short stories.</p><p>DC and Michael McGannon's stories draw from and contribute to the ongoing resurgence of Japanese folklore.

Chaplin&#39;s film career as the Little Tramp adored by the whole world is the stuff of legend, but this frank autobiography shows another side. Born into a theatrical family, Chaplin&#39;s father died of drink while his mother, unable to bear the poverty, suffered from bouts of insanity. From a childhood of grinding poverty in the south London slums, Chaplin found an escape in his early debut on the music hall stage, followed by his lucky break in America, the founding of United Artists with D.W. Griffith and Douglas Fairbanks, the struggle to maintain artistic control over his work, the string of failed marriages, and his eventual exile from Hollywood after personal scandals and persecution for his left-wing politics during the McCarthy Era. Sir Charles &#39;Charlie&#39; Chaplin (1895-1976) was born in Walworth, London. Best known for his work in silent film, his most famous role was The Little Tramp, a universally recognisable and iconic character who appeared in films such as The Kid (1921), The Gold Rush (1925) and City Lights (1931). His other films include Modern Times (1936), a commentary on the Great Depression, and The Great Dictator (1940), a satirical attack on Hitler and the Nazis.</p><p>12 1.5-hour cassettes<b>SIR CHARLES SPENCER &#x201c;CHARLIE&#x201d; CHAPLIN</b> was born in 1889 in London to impoverished parents. He began performing at age ten as a member of a juvenile clog-dance troupe. In 1913, while he was touring with a vaudeville act in the US, Keystone films recruited Chaplin to make films. In only his second short&#x2014;<i>Kid Auto Races at Venice</i>&#x2014;he debuted his &#x201c;Little Tramp&#x201d; character, and his fame quickly exploded. He went on to write, direct, and star in some of the most critically acclaimed movies ever made, including the classics <i>The Gold Rush, City Lights, The Great Dictator</i>, <i>Monsieur Verdoux</i>, and <i>Modern Times</i>&#x2014;for which he also wrote the song &#x201c;Smile,&#x201d; still a standard. In 1919 he founded the United Artists film studio along with Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, and D.W. Griffith, and in 1929, the first year of the Academy Awards, he won an award for &#x201c;versatility and genius&#x201d; in <i>The Circus</i>. But Chaplin&#x2019;s career took a dark turn during the McCarthy era, when he was accused of &#x201c;un-American activities&#x201d; and monitored by the FBI; he would later satirize the McCarthy committee in his <i>A King in New York</i>, but when he visited the UK in 1952 his re-entry permit to the US was revoked. Objecting to what he described as &#x201c;lies and propaganda by powerful reactionary groups&#x201d;, he moved with his family to Switzerland, where he would live until his death on Christmas day 1977. <br><br> <b>DAVID ROBINSON </b>is a film critic and author and a biographer of Charlie Chaplin.

One must walk the battlefields of the Civil War to know and appreciate what happened there. The same is true of historic houses, which take on the character of the people who lived there. This splendid narrative and photographic tour of homes inhabited by obscure as well as important figures in the Civil War era offers enlightenment as well as entertainment."&#x2015;<b><i>James M. McPherson, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <i>Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era</i></i></b><br><br>"This book is a gem. Author Howard and photographer Straus provide an unusual perspective on the Civil War era by focusing on houses associated with some two dozen actors and actresses in that great drama. The famous - Lincoln, Davis, Grant, and Lee - are here, as are John Brown and Frederick Douglass, but also the little-known, like Rowland Robinson and Mary Moore. The writer and photographer weave houses and personal histories into a fascinating story of Americans caught up in a mighty conflict."&#x2015;<b><i>William J. Cooper, Boyd Professor at Louisiana State University and author of <i>Jefferson Davis, American</i></i></b><br><br>"The Civil War proved Lincoln's warning that a 'house divided against itself cannot stand.' However, many of the actual houses of that roiling period withstood not only the war, but the test of time since-and it is a revelation to see them as they look today, and learn about the families who then and since have dwelled in and preserved them.

Upcoming collaborations include an original fairy tale about a lonely princess who decides to become a hairdresser. They live in Utah with their nine children.Ages 6^-9. A truly wonderful mix of storytelling and art from a husband-wife team with a fine sense of humor. Having a familiar fairy tale at its heart, this homespun yarn tells the whimsical story of a small-town girl who has big dreams. Fanny Agnes is convinced that if Cinderella could go to the ball and meet a handsome prince "once upon a time, it could happen again. After all, what were fairy godmothers for?" But when farmer Heber Jensen shows up instead of a fairy godmother, Fanny takes it in stride. After an hour of serious thought ("even with all that moonlight" ), she gives up her dreams and accepts his marriage proposal. It's a total surprise when, years later, the fairy godmother, all glittery in pink and blue and yellow, finally shows up to take Fanny away. The story may be too subtle for the usual picture-book audience, which must be able to appreciate the wit as well as the parody. But Fanny Agnes is a delight: a feminist with a wry sense of humor, she balances her dreams with common sense and a loving heart. What's more, there's plenty for youngsters to enjoy in the robust, bucolic pictures, which seem almost to jump off the page. Rich, glowing colors and a plethora of detail--from pictures on walls to animal shapes in the clouds and a spunky black cat to search out on each spread--give the story enough charm and energy to make it a favorite. <i>Stephanie Zvirin</i></p><h2>The Mystery of Chimney Rock (Choose Your Own Adventure, No. 5)</h2><p>The reader decides the course of events in the exploration of a mysterious house discovered while visiting cousins</p><p></p><h2>Green Lantern Corps: Ring Quest</h2><p>In the wake of the Sinestro Corp War, universal peacekeepers the Green Lantern Corp are assigned a mission of extreme importance: find the missing yellow Power Rings and keep them from creating a new Sinestro Corps.</p><p>Peter Tomasi is the writer of the acclaimed miniseries The Light Brigade as well as having written stories for Outsiders and JSA Classified.

The sky couldn't have been a lovelier shade of violet. But then, the countryside in northern Virginia was some of the most beautiful in the world.<br><br>More so than ever before, at least to her.<br><br>In the past year, she had come to appreciate such simple thing as the colors of life. It had been such a strange year, filled with vividly conflicting emotions. The touch of the sun, the color of a dawn, seemed more intense than ever. The anguish of learning to live alone still interrupted the newfound beauty. Life had become doubly precious, except that she felt it was such an incredible gift that it should be shared...yet she was alive and Matt was dead. <br><br>The setting sun was beautiful, and the night breeze sweet and soft.

She removed the last few specks, and then...<br><br>Yes!<br><br>She continued to brush away the dirt from the skull fragment in the crevice, feeling a sense of jubilation. She couldn't be certain, of course, not absolutely, but it looked like they had discovered the old St. Mathias graveyard that Professor David Laymon had been certain was here. She eyed the skull for size and shape. Bones weren't her specialty. She knew objects, fabrics, even architecture, all the things that made up life, backward and forward. She knew bones only because she had come across them in her work so often.<br><br>The fragments of calico by the skull hinted at a type of hair decoration that fit perfectly with Laymon's belief that this section of the graveyard had been reserved for indentured servants, slaves and those who were simply too poor to pay for anything better.<br><br>"Brad!"<br><br>"Yeah?"<br><br>Brad Verdun, her good friend and colleague, was busy working a few yards away. As she waited for his attention, she took her tweezers and carefully collected the bits of fabric she had discovered; a lab analysis would verify her thoughts, she was certain, but every little shred needed to be preserved.<br><br>"Brad!"<br><br>"Yeah, yeah." At last he dusted his hands and rose, then walked to where she was working. He swore softly, shaking his head. "You were right. Again." He stared at her a little skeptically. "If I didn't know you so well, I just might agree with everyone else that you're psychic."<br><br>She smiled a little uneasily. "You would have chosen the same spot yourself," she assured him.<br><br>"Yeah, eventually." He looked across the work site, staring at the professor, who was down on his hands and knees about fifty yards away. "Well, princess of the past, announce your discovery. Give the old boy his thrill for the night."<br><br>"You tell him."<br><br>"You found the bones."<br><br>"We work together," she said modestly. "You were just a few feet away."<br><br>"You made the discovery."<br><br>"We came as a team, a package deal," she reminded him stubbornly.<br><br>"I won't take your credit."<br><br>"I want you to take the credit! Please?"<br><br>He sighed deeply. "All right, all right. I'll bring him over. But I won't lie."<br><br>"You're not lying if you say we found it as a team," she insisted.<br><br>He stared at her for a moment, then touched the top of her head with gentle affection. "Okay. You want to stay out of the limelight, kiddo, I'll do my best to help you. For a her an encouraging smile. <br><br>"Thanks," she murmured softly.<br><br>"You're going to be okay. You're coming along just great," he said.<br><br>She nodded, looking down.<br><br>Was she?A year had gone by. She functioned, yes, but she continued to hurt every day. Work was good. Friends were good.<br><br>Nights were torture.<br><br>And life itself...<br><br>Was definitely different. That difference had become clear while she'd still been in the hospital after the explosion. If she hadn't happened to pick up a magazine and seen the article on Adam Harrison and Harrison Investigations... <br><br>Well, she would probably either be dead now&#x2014;having scared herself into an early grave&#x2014;or in a mental hospital. Adam Harrison and his team, especially Nikki Blackhawk, had undoubtedly saved both her life and her sanity. But that was information she shared with no one. Not Brad, and certainly not Professor Laymon. <br><br>She watched as Brad walked over to talk to Laymon. Brad was definitely a good guy, the best. If she'd had a brother, he couldn't have been better to her. Years ago, when they had first started working together, she'd known that he wanted more of a relationship, but no one was ever going to stand a chance against Matt. And in fact, he'd liked Matt so much himself that they'd all fallen into a great friendship. She hesitated, watching Brad, glad that nothing had changed, that he had kept a brotherly distance from her and given his full support without any indication that his affections could turn sexual. She knew she would never feel any differently about him; there came a point in life where someone was a friend and that would never change. Brad was tall, well muscled, patient, intelligent and fun. The perfect guy&#x2014;for someone else. The great thing about their friendship was that they shared their love of what they did. Some of the first enjoyment she had felt since the explosion that had killed Matt had been because of Brad, because of the excitement in his dark and arresting eyes when they made a discovery. <br><br>In large part thanks to him, sometimes, she could even have fun these days, going for drinks or dinner after work. His presence kept other guys away, but if he wanted to start something up with someone else, she didn't get in the way.<br><br>They had worked well together before the accident. <br><br>Now she relied on him more than ever&#x2014;even if she was the one who usually "saw" the past more clearly and homed in on a location with eerily perfect accuracy. Sometimes he eyed her almost warily, but when she shrugged, he let it alone. <br><br>She watched as Laymon listened to Brad. His face lit up as if the sun had risen again purely to shine down on him. He was up in a flash, hurrying to Leslie's side, shouting excitedly and bringing the rest of the team&#x2014;teachers, students and volunteers&#x2014;in his wake. "Watch where you walk," he cautioned. "We don't want all this work trampled." Hopping over one of the plastic lines set out to protect the dig and provide the grid that allowed them to map their finds, he seemed like a little kid, he was so happy.<br><br>He stared at Leslie, eyebrows raised questioningly, then looked down at the skull she'd uncovered before turning back to her again. A broad smile lit his worn features. He pushed his Ben Franklin bifocals up the bridge of his nose and scratched his white-bearded chin. If anyone had ever looked the part of a professor, it was David Laymon. "You've done it," he said.<br><br>"We've done it," she murmured.<br><br>"We'll uncover the rest of the skeleton in the morning, then get it to the folks at the Smithsonian...right away, right away. It's too late to work anymore tonight, but we need to secure this area before we go, then get back to work first thing in the morning. From now on we'll need speed&#x2014;and real care. Leslie, I could hug you. I will hug you!" He drew her to her feet, hugged her, then kissed her on the cheek. She was suffused with color, a blush staining her cheeks, as a burst of applause sounded from all around them.<br><br>"Hey, please," she protested. "We're all in on this, and Brad was the one to cordon off this particular area." <br><br>"Still, what a find," Professor Laymon murmured.<br><br>"You'll need to speak to the press. This is big excitement for this area...for historians everywhere."<br><br>"Please," she said softly, firmly, "let Brad speak to the press. Better yet, the two of you can speak as a team."<br><br>Laymon frowned, looking mildly annoyed. <br><br>"Please," Leslie repeated firmly.<br><br>Laymon sighed deeply, looking at her with sorrow in his gray eyes. "You never used to be so shy," he said. "Okay, sorry, I understand. It's just that..." He shook his head. "I understand. Whatever you want. All right, I'll get the ball rolling for the press conference, and you stay here&#x2014;grab some students to give you a hand&#x2014;and make sure that the site is protected until we get back to it in the morning. I'm going to see to it that we get some police out here to keep an eye on things, too."<br><br>Leslie wasn't sure why anyone would want to disturb a paupers' cemetery, but she knew that plenty of digs had been compromised, even ruined, by intruders in the past. She assured Laymon that she would stand guard until they were battened down for the night.<br><br>He stared at her, letting out a sigh and shaking his head again as he walked away. Brad walked behind him. One of the grad students, a shapely redhead, hurried up alongside Brad, slipping an arm through his. Leslie decided that she would have to tease him about her later.<br><br>For a moment, she wondered what Brad said about her when he decided to get close to a woman. Oh, my friend Leslie? Completely platonic. She was engaged,but there was a terrible accident. She almost died, and her fianc� was killed. Since then she's been having kind of a hard time, so I try to be there for her. But it wasn't that long ago, just a year.... <br><br>Just a year.<br><br>She wondered if she would ever again feel that there was a perfect guy out there for. Right now, all she felt was... <br><br>Cold.<br><br>Just a year. A year since she had buried Matt. Buried her life...<br><br>With a shake, she forced her attention back to her work. <br><br>Despite her determination to call it an early night, she found herself dragged to a celebration dinner. They didn't opt for anything fancy&#x2014;budget would always be important in field work&#x2014;just a chain pancake house on the main highway. But when the group decided to go on to a local tavern for a few drinks, she at last managed to bow out.<br><br>She returned to the residence provided for those higher up in the echelon. She, Laymon, Brad and a few others were housed in a Colonial plantation that was now a charming bed-and-breakfast. Their hostess, a cheerful septuagenarian, rose with the rooster's crow, so she went to bed early. She happily saw them off each morning, and since she was a bit hard of hearing, she was also happy when they came in late at night, because she never heard a thing. <br><br>Very tired herself, but feeling a comforting sense of satisfaction, Leslie helped herself to a cup of hot tea from the well-stocked kitchen left open for the help-yourself pleasure of the guests. She took a seat before the large open hearth that dominated the room and sipped her tea from the comfort of the rocker to the left of the gently burning fire. Within a few minutes, she knew she was not alone.<br><br>She glanced slowly to her side, a smile curving her lips as she looked at the man who had joined her. He had a rounded stomach, emphasized by his plain black waistcoat and the bit of bleached cotton that protruded from his waist-band right where it shouldn't. His wig was a bit messy, but in the style of his time, and the tricornered hat he wore sat perfectly atop it. His hose were thick, white and somewhat worn; his shoes bore handsome buckles. His cheeks were rosy, his eyes a bit dark and small beneath bushy brows. He looked at her and returned her smile with a sigh of satisfaction. "Well, now, it's good and done, eh?" he asked her.<br><br>She nodded. "And you mustn't worry, Reverend Donegal. It's true that some of the bones will be boxed and sent for analysis, but the people at the Smithsonian are very careful and reverent. They'll be returned, and we'll see to it that all the dead are reinterred with prayers and all the respect that's due them. And I believe that once the significance of what we've found here has been verified, the Park Service will have its way. A lovely memorial and a facsimile of the church will be built, and generations of visitors will be able to enjoy the beautiful countryside and learn about everything that happened here during both the Revolutionary and Civil Wars." Her smile turned slightly rueful. "I know you did a great deal to help refugees during the Revolutionary War, but this very house was a stop for escaping slaves during the days of the Underground Railroad. There was also a Civil War skirmish in the front yard here. It's amazing the place is still standing."<br><br>"Solid construction," Reverend Donegal said sternly.<br><br>"Folks to care for her. Why, I remember, years and years ago, of course, when I came many a Sunday to this house for my tea following services...ah, lovely then, it was. So much excitement and fear. A new country." His eyes darkened, and he seemed troubled for a minute. "Pity...one war always leads to the next. It hurt me to be here...to see so many fine men die, North and South, believing in the same God.... Ah, well, never mind. There's always hope that man will learn from his mistakes." He paused, his old eyes clouding, and she knew he was looking back to his own time, firmly fixed in his mind. <br><br>Of course, she knew his story. He had worshipped the hostess of his very house from afar, always entirely circumspect, but enjoying every opportunity to be in her company. He had faithfully served his flock of parishioners; a good man. His one pleasure had been his Sunday tea. And so, one day, he had come here, had his tea...and then died of a heart attack in the arms of the woman he had secretly adored for so many years. Leslie had thought at first that he must have been a very sad ghost, seeking the love he hadn't allowed himself in life. But that hadn't been the case at all. She had discovered that he had been at peace with himself; that his distant and unrequited love for Mrs. Adella Baxter had in actuality been a pleasant fantasy but not one he had truly hoped to fulfill. He had enjoyed his life as a bachelor, administering to his flock. He had stayed all these years because he felt so many of his flock needed to be remembered. In short, he had wanted the graveyard found.<br><br>At first, he hadn't trusted her. He'd tried a dozen tricks, moving her brush around, locking her suitcase, hiding her keys. He hadn't expected her to see him, and he certainly hadn't expected her to get angry, yell at him and demand that they talk. Once they had, he'd become an absolute charmer. Through his eyes, she'd seen the house as it had been in his day. She'd experienced his passion as he'd spoken of what he and so many others had gone through to establish a new country; his fear that he might be hanged as a traitor&#x2014;something that had been a distinct possibility many times during the brutal years of the Revolution. He was deeply disturbed that so few of the people who passed through the old house were aware of just how precarious the struggle for freedom had been. "You can't understand," he had told her. "We almost lost the war. In fact, it's a miracle that we won. And all those men who signed the Declaration of Independence? They would have been hanged! So many risked so much.Ah, well, God does show his will, against al...</p><h2>The Shyness &amp; Social Anxiety Workbook: Proven Techniques for Overcoming Your Fears</h2><p>This step-by-step guide to overcoming fear of social interaction provides a comprehensive overview and includes behavioral skill-building exercises that have been proven effective in most cases.</p><p>Martin M.

As the boat began to sink, her crew of thirty had time only to collect some bread and water before pulling away in three frail open boats. Without charts, alone on the open seas, and thousands of miles from any known land, the sailors began their terrifying journey of survival. Ninety days later, after much suffering and death by starvation, intense heat, and dehydration, only eight men survived to reach land. One of them was Owen Chase, first mate of the ill-fated ship, whose account of the long and perilous journey has become a classic of endurance and human courage. The elements of his tale inspired Herman Melville (who was born the year the Essex sank) to write the classic Moby Dick. A gallant saga of the sea, this riveting narration of life and death, of man against the deep, will enthrall readers.<br></p><p>On November 20, 1820, a sperm whale repeatedly rammed the whaleship <i>Essex</i>, causing her to sink. The 20-man crew were left in three small, open boats in the middle of the Pacific with little food and only 200 gallons of water. Bereft of charts, the boats sailed due east in the hopes of sighting land. Battered by storms, the boats became separated. Some 90 days later, a few men were rescued--but not before they had been forced to make a terrible decision. <blockquote>I have no language to paint the horrors of our situation. To shed tears was indeed altogether unavailing and withal unmanly; yet I was not able to deny myself the relief they served to afford me.</blockquote> This harrowing, first-hand account by First Mate Owen Chase was originally published in 1821, just months after he returned home to Nantucket, and the unfortunate <i>Essex</i> and her crew passed into legend. Twenty years after the wreck, young William Chase, Owen's son, was serving on the <i>Lima</i> when it met another whaler called the <i>Acushnet</i>. The crews spent some time together, and Chase told his father's story to 21-year-old Herman Melville, and lent him a copy of his father's book. The story clearly caught Melville's imagination--"The reading of this wondrous story upon the landless sea, and close to the very latitude of the shipwreck had a surprising effect on me"--and ten years later he published <i>Moby Dick</i>. Literary inspiration aside, <i>The Wreck of the Whaleship</i> Essex is a well-told, truly gripping tale. As Gary Kinder (who, as the author of <i>Ship of Gold in the Deep Blue Sea</i>, knows a thing or two about shipwrecks) notes in his introduction, "As you sit in your chair, the subliminal thought recurs: My god, this really happened." <i>--Sunny Delaney</i>Iola Haverstick was a reporter for Life for several years.

During his research, Tim Choy became increasingly interested in the power of the notion of specificity. While documenting the expert and lay production of Hong Kong&#x2019;s biological, cultural, and political specificities, he began comparing the logics and narrative forms that made different types of specificity&#x2014;such as species, culture, locality, and state autonomy&#x2014;possible and meaningful. He came to understand these logics and forms as &#x201c;ecologies of comparison,&#x201d; conceptual practices through which an event or form of life comes to matter in environmentalist and other political terms. Choy&#x2019;s ethnography is about environmentalism, Hong Kong, and the ways that we think about environmentalism in Hong Kong and other places. It is also about how politics, freedom, culture, expertise, and other concepts figure in comparison-based knowledge practices.</p><p><p>Tim Choy is Associate Professor in the Science and Technology Studies Program and the Department of Anthropology at the University of California, Davis.</p>&#x201c;[A]n exquisite anthropological account of how recent environmental campaigns in Hong Kong resonate with social and political dilemmas surrounding its return to Chinese sovereignty.Choy&#x2019;s book provides a reviving<br>breath to the study of environmentalism and to our understanding of postcolonial Hong Kong.&#x201d; - Julian M. Groves, <i>Anthropological Quarterly</i><br><br>&#x201c;While demanding, Choy&#x2019;s ethnographic method also appears quite inviting. With it, he is able to move easily from theoretical questions regarding the construction of scientific truth and expertise to the shifting scales of mass media and local, even personal, anecdotes. Ultimately, his ethnographic approach with its attention to detail avoids being simply a means to an end; instead it stands in as a positive example of the negotiations and comparisons that we make as we live amidst the shifting terrain of contemporary culture.&#x201d; - Benjamin K. Hodges, <i>Journal of Anthropological Research </i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Ecologies of Comparison</i> is a stimulating ethnography...The book will be of interest to anthropologists, sociologists, science studies scholars, and Asian studies scholars alike.&#x201d; - Peter C. Little, <i>Electronic Green Journal</i><br><br>&#x201c;This beautifully written book urges us to take another look at some of our most important tools for thinking. What do comparisons do? Why do we use examples? When does it matter if components of our world are specific to their times and places? <i>Ecologies of Comparison</i> offers a stimulating tour into both Hong Kong&#x2019;s environmental politics and the work of political analysis itself.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing</b>, author of <i>Friction: An Ethnography of Global Connection</i><br><br>&#x201c;Tim Choy&#x2019;s much-anticipated meditation on the many forms of life to be found in Hong Kong environmentalism is a bracing read. Taking knowledge itself as his object, Choy shows how the deep complicity of ethnography, theory, and politics offers not only profound challenges to scholarly practice but also new opportunities and horizons. <i>Ecologies of Comparison</i> is original, contemporary, and resonant.

When Ixco?auqui, son of the sun god, defies his father's order not to venture beyond the garden wall, he meets and falls in love with Coyolxauhqui, daughter of the moon goddess. The other gods agree to their marriage, yet the disapproving sun god will bless the union only if the couple vows never to leave the heavens; if they break the vow, they will lose their immortality. As in the Garden of Eden, the lovers' curiosity causes them to transgress, and they are banished from the heavens. Later, when Coyolxauhqui becomes gravely ill, her husband carries her to a mountaintop, promising never to leave her side. The gods then "transformed the two young lovers into two mountains." Fisher's acrylic paintings range from austere, boldly hued portraits of the warriorlike celestial residents to verdant landscapes of both heaven and earth. Youngsters are likely to find the connection between the story and the geological formations intriguing, and its parallels with Adam and Eve may make for some lively discussion. A pronunciation guide appears at tale's end. Ages 4-8. (Mar.) <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.With Adam and Eve^-like overtones, this picture book for older readers tells the Aztec legend of Ixcocauqui, the son of the sun god, who is forbidden to go beyond the garden wall. Curiosity, of course, gets the best of him, and he meets the daughter of the moon, Coyolxauhqui. They fall in love, but the sun god will allow their marriage only if the lovers agree never to visit earth. The husband and wife break their vow, and they are sent to live on earth forever. Their life is difficult, but not without the pleasures of learning, acquiring skills, and dancing and singing together. When Coyolxauhqui grows ill and dies, the gods transform the two young lovers into mountains overlooking the Valley of Mexico. This is a companion to Kimmel's <i>Montezuma and the Fall of the Aztecs</i>. Leonard Everett Fisher's illustrations, as always, have definition and strength, but here they are also brillantly colored. The reds and greens are remarkably pure, but it is the gold that adorns everything--from a headdress to a bracelet to a wall of gold--that is so realistic and vibrant that readers will want to reach out and touch.

He refuses to relegate the idea of humans becoming holy to the realm of individual inward piety or legalism, on the one hand, or to the realm of the impossible prior to Christ&#39;s return, on the other. Using a missional lens to guide the reader into a theological engagement with Scripture, Johnson argues that God&#39;s primary means of making us holy is through our participation in his saving, reconciling mission to bring creation to its intended destiny. As we become and remain part of an ecclesia, we are corporately and personally shaped by the Spirit into the image of the cruciform Son through participation in the missio Dei, and thereby are being restored into the image of the holy God--the imago Dei. This book is written primarily for church leaders, for students, and for academics who are interested in missional readings of Scripture. It will challenge those who read it to re-articulate the church&#39;s becoming holy as being inseparably connected to its active participation in God&#39;s mission.</p><p>Andy Johnson is Professor of New Testament at Nazarene Theological Seminary in Kansas City, Missouri.

Ahead of her, just a breath away, lay the outside world &#x2013; the teeming hustle and bustle of life that lay all about, but which she and her fellow pups were seemingly forever forbidden from experiencing.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was all just so tantalizingly close.<br> &nbsp;<br> The English-run Shanghai Dog Kennels had bred the beautiful liver-and-white English Pointer puppies to serve as gundogs for various English gentlemen then resident in Shanghai. But this one pup, it seemed, had other ideas. The Kennels were like an island of calm amid the sea of chaos that was 1936 Shanghai &#x2013; chaos to which the puppy poised halfway under the wire felt irresistibly drawn.<br> &nbsp;<br> Before her very nose rickshaws &#x2013; ancient-looking wooden carts pulled by human bearers &#x2013; tore back and forth as they weaved through the dusty streets, carrying the better-off Shanghai residents trussed up in formal-looking top hats and dress-coats. Those rickety carriages fought for space with trams and buses, chugging their ponderous way past roadside stalls selling freshly fried and spiced delicacies. And everywhere bright red cloth banners hung from the shopfronts, advertising their wares in exotic-looking Mandarin and Wu calligraphy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Why it was only she of her siblings who felt this insatiable urge to see, to smell and to taste the wider world &#x2013; to escape &#x2013; she didn&#x2019;t know. But ever since birth, curiosity had seemed to get the better of this, still nameless puppy. And now here she was, glistening nose thrust under the wire and twitching at the bewitching smells that assaulted it, round and chubby backside still within the safe confines of the kennel, but with only a few more wriggles and a final squeeze required to break free.<br> &nbsp;<br> Doubtless, one voice inside the pup&#x2019;s head was telling her: don&#x2019;t do it! But another, equally strident voice was urging &#x2013; go for it, girl! In that moment of indecision as she peered beneath the wire the little puppy heard a yell of alarm from behind. She&#x2019;d been spotted! It was the cry of Lee Ming, the local Chinese girl whose mother lived and worked at the kennels, raising the alarm. Lee Ming was quick and nimble and would be on her like a flash unless she got a move on.<br> &nbsp;<br> Tiny forepaws thrashed and scrabbled at the dirt, as she fought to squeeze her way under the wire. The wrinkly folds of puppy fat rolled and gave beneath her, as she got her belly down even lower and wriggled like a fat fish stuck on an angler&#x2019;s hook. The bare stub of a tail, sticking out behind her like a long and rigid finger, twitched to and fro as she strove with all her might to break free.<br> &nbsp;<br> Behind her Lee Ming came to a sudden halt and reached to grab the disobedient puppy, but as she did so the tiny ball of irrepressible energy gave one last Herculean effort and she was through. An instant and a scamper later and &#x2013; pouf! &#x2013; the diminutive four-legged figure was gone, paws flying as she was swallowed up into the noise and dust and utter disorder of downtown Shanghai.<br> &nbsp;<br> For a horrible moment Lee Ming stared after the puppy that had disappeared, in complete dismay. There were so many dangers stalking those city streets that she didn&#x2019;t have the heart to imagine the half of them. If there was one thing the little puppy wasn&#x2019;t, it was streetwise. In her headlong confusion she might be run over by a rickshaw. In her fright she might tumble into one of the city&#x2019;s myriad open sewers. But worst of all, a roly-poly puppy like her would offer a tantalizing meal to those partial to dog meat &#x2013; which included the large majority of the city&#x2019;s native population.<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1936 Shanghai the flesh of man&#x2019;s best friend was much sought-after, being seen as something of a &#x2018;sweet&#x2019;-tasting delicacy. A young and tender dog that no one seemed to own or to care for would be fair game. Lee Ming turned back towards the large, colonial-style house that lay in the centre of the kennel compound. She headed for reception to report the bad news, and to help raise whatever search party they would send after the wayward pup. But her heart was heavy and a dark foreboding lay upon her.<br> &nbsp;<br> She feared very much that was the last they&#x2019;d ever see of the puppy that had run away.<br> &nbsp;<br> ==#==<br> &nbsp;<br> The Shanghai that the puppy had made a break for was no place for any defenceless being, let alone an English Pointer barely a few weeks old. Then a city of some three million inhabitants, Shanghai &#x2013; a port city lying in the very centre of China&#x2019;s coastline &#x2013; was a bustling metropolis red in tooth and claw. Positioned at the mouth of the mighty Yangtze River &#x2013; Asia&#x2019;s longest, and a vital conduit for trade and commerce into China&#x2019;s vast interior &#x2013; the great powers of Britain, America and France had long-established trading settlements in the city.<br> &nbsp;<br> For decades, Shanghai had been known as &#x2018;The Paris of the East&#x2019;, but in recent years she had become a city beset by troubles. Weak leadership and infighting among the Chinese government had allowed vicious gangs of bandits to thrive. Warlords had taken control of large tracts of the nation&#x2019;s interior. Increasingly, Britain, America and France had been forced to send gunboats far into the interior on the Yangtze, in an effort to dissuade these lawless elements from disrupting their lucrative trade in silk, cotton, tea and other valuable commodities.<br> &nbsp;<br> Recently, trouble had piled upon trouble, in particular with the resurgence of China&#x2019;s age-old enemy &#x2013; Japan. In an escalating series of bloody skirmishes the Japanese Navy had bombarded Shanghai. As they had with the British and the other &#x2018;great powers&#x2019;, the Chinese were forced to sign a treaty with Imperial Japan, allowing the Japanese to establish a permanent presence in the &#x2018;treaty port&#x2019; of Shanghai. Imperial Japan made little secret of her desire to conquer and subjugate the entire Chinese nation, and Shanghai was the gateway to China&#x2019;s then capital city, Nanking.<br> &nbsp;<br> This then was Shanghai, the city that the escapee from the kennels had absconded to &#x2013; one menaced by gangland banditry, and whose streets were increasingly plagued by soldiers from Imperial Japan, who showed ill-disguised contempt for the local inhabitants. So it was something of a miracle that several weeks after her dramatic breakout, the puppy who had run away was still very much alive and breathing.<br> &nbsp;<br> The silky chubbiness was long gone, of course. Instead, adolescent ribs poked through a liver-and-white coat that had lost much of its shine and lustre. Her nose was dry and cracked, a sure sign that she was in a dreadful condition. Only her eyes seemed to demonstrate their signature brightness, betraying a strength of character that had distinguished her from birth, and perhaps led to her present, unenviable predicament. They shone with a burning curiosity and a zest for life, despite all that she had suffered since her ill-fated &#x2018;escape&#x2019;. But there was something else now in her gaze &#x2013; uncertainty and vulnerability, a sense that the young dog had realized to her cost that not every human was her natural friend and ally.<br> &nbsp;<br> How stupid she had been, she now recognized, to run away. She had traded the comfort and luxury of the kennels for a battered old cardboard box lying in a smelly, fly-blown Shanghai alleyway. She&#x2019;d traded the companionship and playfulness of her brother and sister puppies for the loneliness of life on the streets. And in place of the English kennel owner&#x2019;s natural love for and protection over their dogs, she&#x2019;d faced cruelty and abuse at every turn in this overcrowded human zoo of a city.<br> &nbsp;<br> All apart from one individual &#x2013; Soo. For whatever reason, Soo the Chinese trader was an unreconstructed lover of dogs. Her shabby box-cum-home lay to the rear of his store, and ever since the puppy had found her way to it Soo had taken it upon himself to deliver titbits of food to her, of an evening when his long day&#x2019;s work was done. It was hardly the kind of diet she&#x2019;d grown accustomed to at the kennels, but at least it had served to keep her alive.<br> &nbsp;<br> Like many Chinese, it wasn&#x2019;t in Soo&#x2019;s nature or family tradition to keep a dog at home as a pet. In the China of 1936 dogs had to earn their keep as working animals, or they were invariably for the pot. In fact, the eating of dog meat in China had a history stretching back thousands of years, the meat being thought to possess mystical medicinal properties. There were even some breeds of dog that were kept specifically for human consumption, especially in times of seasonal hunger.<br> &nbsp;<br> Fortunately, Soo wasn&#x2019;t one of those who were partial to having dog on the menu, and the lost puppy from the Shanghai Dog Kennels was lucky indeed to have fallen by chance under his protection.<br> &nbsp;<br> But tonight, all of that was about to change.<br> &nbsp;<br> With a sixth sense that was to become her absolute trademark, the lonely pup detected the danger before it was audible or visible to any human ear or eye, Soo&#x2019;s included. A Japanese gunboat had docked in the port of Shanghai, and the sailors of the His Japanese Imperial Majesty&#x2019;s Ship were making their noisy way along the very road upon which Soo&#x2019;s shop was situated, no doubt in search of alcohol and some locals on which to vent their aggression. It was late evening, but the hardworking Soo was still there, his being one of the few stores on the street remaining open.<br> &nbsp;<br> That alone offered enough of an excuse for the gunboat crew to pounce.<br> &nbsp;<br> As the Japanese sailors started verbally abusing Soo and helping themselves to his wares, he of course protested. Voices were raised in anger, but the Japanese sailors didn&#x2019;t stop there. Within minutes Soo&#x2019;s shop had been plundered, its rickety wooden shelves torn down and smashed to pieces. As for Soo, he was set upon by the Japanese sailors, who were working themselves up into a towering rage.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hearing her one protector in the world being so cruelly assaulted, the adolescent pup had stolen out of her alleyway and sneaked around the corner to see if there was anything she could do to save him. Inching forward on her belly, she alternately whimpered in fright and tried to muster her most threatening growl, as the strange figures in their baggy trousers over knee-high black boots kicked and punched her protector.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then one of the aggressors spotted the cowering dog. He stepped away from Soo and took a few paces towards her. Moments later one of those perfectly polished boots was swinging towards the adolescent puppy&#x2019;s midriff. The powerful blow lifted her from the cobbles and flung her across the street into a pile of rubbish on the far side. There she lay, whimpering and in agony, and hoping beyond hope that these cruel men in their strange uniforms wouldn&#x2019;t come for her again.<br> &nbsp;<br> By the time their oppressors had departed, Soo had been beaten so badly that he had to be helped away from the scene. The dog that had until now viewed him as her protector was forced to take refuge in the empty shadows of a nearby doorway. Into it she crawled, body sore from the kicking, belly sore from that and the ravening hunger, and her spirit numbed by the trauma and the cold of the long night that lay ahead.<br> &nbsp;<br> Even though the Japanese sailors were long gone, the lonely puppy sensed that tonight her dream of escape from the Shanghai Kennels had descended into the blackest of nightmares &#x2013; but as is so often the case, the darkest moment is just before the dawn.<br> &nbsp;<br> As the sun crept above the city&#x2019;s grand, colonial-style skyline, a familiar figure began to pad her way along the street on which the young dog lay. The lone puppy was shivering and crying to herself and lost in misery &#x2013; so much so that she almost didn&#x2019;t notice the pitter-patter of footsteps come to a halt, or to hear the words uttered in amazement in her direction.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Shudi? Shudi? Oh, Shudi! What happened? Where have you been?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> The long tail of the Pointer &#x2013; now stained off-white with the dirt and soot from her street-side existence &#x2013; almost failed to wag in any sign of recognition. But the young dog had recognized the soft tones of the voice, just as surely as the little girl from the kennels had recognized the distraught puppy. Her distinctive markings &#x2013; a sleek liver-brown head, a similarly-coloured saddle-like marking thrown across her shoulders, plus the large formless splodge of colour splashed across her rear right flank &#x2013; had been instantly recognizable to Lee Ming.<br> &nbsp;<br> No doubt about it &#x2013; this was the one that had run away!<br> &nbsp;<br> In a sprawling city of some three million inhabitants the girl from the Shanghai Kennels had, by chance, chosen to walk that morning past the very door where the lost and injured dog was sheltering. Lee Ming bent, scooped the puppy up and thrust her deep inside her jacket. With that she ran and skipped through the largely deserted streets, eager to announce her find to the English lady who ran the kennels.<br> &nbsp;<br> By the time she had reached the big house that lay inside the compound and unzipped her jacket, the puppy had fallen fast asleep.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Look! Look! I find Shudi!&#x2019; the little girl announced ecstatically.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Englishwoman peered doubtfully over the high desk behind which she sat. Spying the puppy, she reached out uncertainly and took the little dog from the girl&#x2019;s outstretched arms. She pulled her closer, stroked her and fondled her just behind the ears, as she studied the markings and tried to compare them to those in her memory. The puppy opened one lazy eye, saw where she was, seemed to smile exhaustedly then slipped back into a sweet sleep.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was the turn of the Englishwoman to smile. &#x2018;It is her. It really is the one who ran away.&#x2019; She glanced at Lee Ming who was beaming with happiness. &#x2018;So, I think it&#x2019;s time you gave her a good bath and a dinner, don&#x2019;t you?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Lee Ming nodded enthusiastically. There was nothing she&#x2019;d like more than to feed and comfort the wayward pup. She held out her arms so &#x2018;Shudi&#x2019; could be returned to her and she could whisk her off for some much-needed tender loving care.<br> &nbsp;<br> The woman handed the pup across. She glanced at Lee Ming curiously. &#x2018;But tell me, why do you call her Shudi?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Lee Ming placed the warm but exhausted bundle back inside her jacket. &#x2018;I always call this one Shudi,&#x2019; she replied shyly. &#x2018;Shudi means peaceful. Peaceful is how she looks, yes?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> The woman reached out and caressed Lee Ming&#x2019;s face. &#x2018;She does. Yes she does. And Lee Ming &#x2013; that shall be her name from now on: Judy.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> So it was that the puppy who had run away and come back again against all odds was given a name perhaps most ill-suited to her nature: the Mandarin word for the peaceful one &#x2013; shudi &#x2013; or rendered into &#x2018;Judy&#x2019; for whichever lucky Englishman might be her future master.<br> &nbsp;<br> As the little girl carried Shudi &#x2013; Judy &#x2013; off for a good pamper, little did she realize how a dog with such inauspicious beginnings would go on to distinguish herself in the coming bloody and allconsuming conflict . . .<br> &nbsp;<br> Lee Ming could have no idea how famous the English Pointer from the Shanghai Kennels would become, once the Second World War drew to a close.<br></p><h2>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</h2><p>Ian Fleming, best known for his James Bond novels, wrote only one children&#x2019;s book&#x2014;and it is a classic! Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is the name of the flying, floating, driving-by-itself automobile that takes the Pott family on a riotous series of adventures as they try to capture a notorious gang of robbers. This is a story filled with humor, adventure, and gadgetry that only a genius like Fleming could create.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>Ian Fleming was born in 1908. After extensive studies, he joined Reuters News Service in 1929 and was stationed in London, Berlin, and Moscow. During World War II, he spent several years in the British Intelligence Service, which well prepared him to create the enigmatic 007, and the fantasmic auto, Chitty.The Potts are not an ordinary family, so one wouldn't expect them to buy an ordinary car. And they don't. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang turns out to be a most unusual car, and she sees the family through adventure after adventure. Andrew Sachs is the perfect reader for this production. His British accent sets the scene, and his proper delivery heightens the silliness as Chitty Chitty Bang Bang reveals her secrets to the Potts. Sachs creates enough variations in the voices of the main characters to distinguish one from another. This production is ideal for road trips and will keep the entire family laughing. A.F. � AudioFile 2004, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>Ship, Sea &amp; Sky: The Marine Art of James Edward Buttersworth</h2><p>Presents fifty works by the nineteenth-century seascape painter</p><p>A skilled genre painter of the mid-nineteenth century, Buttersworth--along with many competitors of the palette on the East Coast--worked when steam displaced sail, the elegant clipper ship reigned (briefly) supreme, and after the Civil War, when speedy yachts became popular. He effaced his personality more accurately to portray marine architecture, but he was no dullard "pierhead" painter. His imagination dramatized the setting, depicting heeling vessels in stormy weather, for example, that set off his capable rendering of the protean seascape, with its scudding clouds, wind-whipped waves, and fractious light.

Ross's most recent work is a series of photographs of people in Pennsylvania protesting the war in Iraq, the majority of which were taken at a protest called "Eyes Wide Open," organized by the Quaker community.<br>The personal connection Ross forges with her subjects is palpable and results in pictures that are sensitive reflections of both empowerment and vulnerability. With a remarkable ability to navigate socio-economic boundaries with ease, Ross creates touching portraits characterized by their candor, naturalism and fidelity to each subject's sense of self. They are revelations not only of the individuals but of humanity at large.</p><p></p><h2>An Egyptian Novel (Hebrew Literature)</h2><p>The protagonist has Egyptian roots going back many generations: on her father&#x2019;s side, to the expulsion of the Jews of Spain in 1492, when seven brothers of the Kastil family (from Castilla) landed on the Gaza coast after many trials and tribulations. Her mother&#x2019;s side goes back even further, to the only family that Jewish history has ignored: the ones who said &#x201c;No&#x201d; to Moses and stayed in Egypt. After migrating to Israel in the 1950s and settling on a kibbutz&#x2015;from which they were soon expelled for Stalinism&#x2015;this storied clan moved to Tel Aviv. In this unconventional family saga, Orly Castel-Bloom blends fact with fiction, history with legend, reimagining the lives of her forebears in unforgettable prose.</p><p>Orly Castel-Bloom is a leading voice in Hebrew literature today. Her postmodern classic <i>Dolly City</i> has been included in UNESCO&#x2019;s Collection of Representative Works, and was nominated in 2007 as one of the ten most important books since the creation of the state of Israel. <i>An Egyptian Novel</i> won the Sapir Prize in 2015."Orly Castel-Bloom is a leading voice in Hebrew literature today."

He was inspired by the idea originally formulated by the Roman architect Vitruvius, who suggested that the human body could be made to fit inside a circle, long associated with the divine, and a square, related to the earthly and secular. To place a man inside those shapes was to imply that the human body could indeed be a blueprint for the workings of the universe. Da Vinci elevated Vitruvius&#x2019; idea to exhilarating heights when he set out to do something unprecedented, if the human body truly reflected the cosmos, he reasoned, then studying its anatomy more thoroughly than had ever been attempted before&#x2014;peering deep into body and soul&#x2014;might grant him an almost godlike perspective on the makeup of the world. <br> <br>Written with the same narrative flair and intellectual sweep as Lester&#x2019;s award-winning first book, the &#x201c;almost unbearably thrilling&#x201d; (Simon Winchester) <i>Fourth Part of the World, </i>and beautifully illustrated with Da Vinci's drawings, <i>Da Vinci&#x2019;s Ghost</i> follows Da Vinci on his journey to understanding the secrets of the Vitruvian man. It captures a pivotal time in Western history when the Middle Ages were giving way to the Renaissance, when art, science, and philosophy were rapidly converging, and when it seemed possible that a single human being might embody&#x2014;and even understand&#x2014;the nature of the universe.</p><p>Toby Lester is the author of <i>The Fourth Part of the World </i>(2009) and a contributing editor to <i>The Atlantic</i>.

Toby Lester&#x2019;s &#x201c;Da Vinci's Ghost&#x201d; is such a book. Like a detective, Lester uncovers the secrets of an iconic drawing and pieces together a magisterial history of art and ideas and beauty."<b>&#x2014;David Grann, author of <i>The Lost City of Z</i></b><br><br>"In reconstructing the forgotten story of Vitruvian Man, Toby Lester, a canny decoder of &nbsp;images and a great storyteller, sheds new light on the enigmatic Leonardo DaVinci."<b>&#x2014;Chris Anderson, Editor in Chief of <i>Wired, </i>author of <i>The Long Tail</i> and <i>Free</i></b><br><br>"Erudite, elegant, enthralling.

Stories are the way we organize the chaos in our lives, orchestrate voluminous factual material, and -- if we are very good -- shed some light on the human condition." Here are twenty-six pieces that showcase the best travel writing from 2005, filled with "keen observations that transform ordinary journeys into extraordinary ones" (Library Journal). <br><br>Mark Jenkins journeys into a forgotten valley in Afghanistan, Kevin Fedarko takes a wild ride through the rapids of the Grand Canyon, and Christopher Solomon reports on the newest fad to hit South Korea: downhill skiing. For David Sedaris, a seemingly routine domestic flight is cause for a witty rumination on modern airline travel. Alain de Botton describes the discreet charms of Zurich, and Ian Frazier recalls leaving the small Midwestern town he called home. Michael Paterniti gives a touching portrait of the world's tallest man -- eight and a half feet and growing, while P.J. O'Rourke visits an airplane manufacturer to see firsthand how the French make the world's biggest passenger plane. George Saunders is dazzled by a trip to the "Vegas of the Middle East," Rolf Potts takes on tantric yoga for dilettantes, and Sean Flynn documents a seedier side of travel -- the newest hotspot in the international sex trade. <br><br>Culled from a wide variety of publications, these stories, as Cahill writes, all "touched me in one way or another, changed an attitude, made me laugh aloud, or provided fuel for my dreams.

His work can be found at jasonwilson.com.<br> &nbsp;</p>Introduction<br><br>Several decades ago, when I first started publishing travel books, it was necessary to look for a knowledgeable clerk to help find my tomes when they hit the stores. I might find my latest darlings under current events&#x201d; or new nonfiction&#x201d; or humor.&#x201d; There weren&#x2019;t travel writing&#x201d; aisles in major bookstores. You could find travel guides, but not travel writing.&#x201d; All that has changed in the last dozen years or so. Bookstores have discovered that there are such things as the travel essay, the travel book, and now some stores actually specialize in travel writing. This has led me to conclude that there are now a lot more writers who specialize in travel, and, concurrently, many more readers interested in reading those writers. We seem to be in a golden age of American travel writing and may actually be closing in on some of the great English travel writers who wrote timeless books and essays in the age of Empire and just after. (This is an arguable proposition and one that, I admit, may well be an inexcusable overstatement.) There was, of course, a hiccup in demand and production just after the events of September 11, 2001, but I sense that, lately, both output and demand have picked up considerably. Magazines are once again assigning writers to seek out remote and sometimes dangerous locations, or to come back with new insights concerning more familiar areas.<br> In the magazines that assign such work, the word article&#x201d; is never used. One writes a piece&#x201d; or sometimes, a story.&#x201d; It is the latter definition that I prefer.<br> My own opinion is that story&#x201d; is the essence of the travel essay. Stories are the way we organize the chaos in our lives, orchestrate voluminous factual material, and if we are very good shed some light on the human condition, such as it is.<br> I realize that there are many very good travel writers, people who interview this person and that, eliciting contrasting views in the manner of a good daily reporter, and those fine writers did not find their way into this book, due entirely to my own prejudice in the matter. Information is of immense value, but if I can&#x2019;t find a story, I often feel I&#x2019;m being beaten over the head with an encyclopedia. Stories are the sole written instruments that can bring tears to our eyes, or make us laugh, or even God forbid compel us to think, and thereby perhaps even take a position.<br> Additionally, they&#x2019;re generally more fun to read. (In my entirely biased opinion.) So in choosing pieces&#x201d; for this anthology, I&#x2019;ve looked for the best stories I could find and was brutal in eliminating purely informational material. There is a controversy in the travel writing community concerning such matters. One argument has it that the reader wants to read about his trip, not yours.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m not so sure. Readers want to read, which means they want something that holds their attention. They want to be entertained and informed and amused. If they are reading for information only, modern travelers are blessed with any number of guidebooks, and these volumes seem to become better and more informative every year.<br> But in travel writing, story is of the essence. And if the narrative in question inspires the reader to visit the destination in question, so much the better. I know from letters I&#x2019;ve received, from conversations I&#x2019;ve had at writing seminars and book signings, that some of my own stories have inspired readers to undertake journeys similar to my own. Hell, certain adventure travel companies have made places I&#x2019;ve written about long ago catalogue destinations, and at least one guidebook followed a trip I took years ago, informing independent travelers how to emulate that peculiar journey without encountering the multitude of dead ends and frustrations that my own party encountered. A hearty traveler, book in hand, could in ten days make the trip that took my party the better part of a month.<br> Guidebooks are about logistics; stories arise from the heart, and are the essence of travel. Ask anyone who has just returned from a trip how it went, and you are not likely to get directions. You&#x2019;ll hear stories. In this book, our storytellers have blundered across the globe and come back with essays and articles that I hope will make you laugh, cry, think, and perhaps dream. Or at least that is what we as travel writers like to believe, and often state aloud in the many conferences devoted to travel writing that take place across the United States every year. New such workshops and seminars are springing up like mushrooms after a rainstorm.<br> These are generally invigorating for both the writers and the attendees who would like to be travel writers. The established writers are forced to think abouut how and why they do what they do, matters I generally never contemplate. As a matter of fact, most writers, meeting casually, do not tttttalk about the process,&#x201d; or narrative arch&#x201d; or the complications of carpentering together a scene.<br> What we talk about is how we were financially sodomized by this publisher or that, and how the latest editor went goose-stepping through our sinuous prose.<br> I suspect the conferences are the only time we think about what we do, and in the dozens I&#x2019;ve attended, it is instructive to watch established literary travel writers oscillate between self-congratulation and self-hate. On the one hand, there is a tendency to imagine that what we do is important and that encouraging people to travel promotes tolerance and understanding. As Mark Twain, who spent much of his early newspaper career as a foreign correspondent,&#x201d; said, Travel is fatal to prejudice.&#x201d; My sense is that most of the writers here would be in agreement.<br> So we like to think of ourselves as emissaries for world peace, for the convergence of cultures, for international harmony, and, by extension, the end of cultural disharmony and even war. If folks are encouraged to travel our route, so much the better; but if they choose to experience the culture from the comfort of a La-Z-Boy, it is of no matter.<br> We, as travel writers, will pat ourselves on the back. Maybe we haven&#x2019;t cured cancer or come up with an AIDS vaccine, but we&#x2019;ve gone to the ends of the earth, almost always on OPM (Other People&#x2019;s Money: the only good-sized hunks of cash most travel writers get to see), and we can congratulate ourselves that we labor in the cause of understanding and world peace.<br> The fact that cultures are still in mortal conflict and that world peace is yet a fantasy suggests that either we are dead wrong, or that we still have a lot of work to do.<br> On the other hand, many of us are consumed with a sort of gentle self-loathing and generally bristle at being called travel writers. Most of the writers you will read here did not aspire to travel as a career. I didn&#x2019;t. We like to think of ourselves as writers first, travelers second. We started out as novelists, narrative nonfiction writers, creative journalists, daily journalists, technical writers. And somehow, one day, in the midst of a personality profile or political piece or the explication of a current crime, some trick of fate, generally in the person of a cruel editor, sent us on an assignment that required travel, and we nailed the story. And that led to a second such assignment, and a third. And suddenly, much to our mystification, we became known as travel writers.<br> The majority of those in my occupation, I imagine, would rather be known as writers who, for reasons not totally explicable, find their best subject matter somewhere beyond the front door.<br> In contrast, the persons we teach or speak to at various seminars actually want to be travel writers. They ask if you need to be in impressive shape to write well about physically difficult assignments, or whether it is necessary to speak several languages, or to be of this gender or that to accomplish certain tasks.<br> And what we tell them is: no, you have to want to be a writer and you have to write. Period.<br> Now, it might be supposed that people who attend such workshops, are, on the whole, hopeless wannabes. This is decidedly not the case. I am literally astonished at the number of people who&#x2019;ve absorbed the message and gone on to a career in publishing. Indeed, I can think of one such former student whose last book was a national bestseller. I know doctors, judges, plumbers, and airline stewards all former workshop attendees who publish travel material regularly in a variety of venues.<br> Maybe these are the folks who will truly generate the golden age of American travel writing, bring harmony to the world, put an end to ecological devastation, and make bagloads of money in the process. God knows their teachers haven&#x2019;t accomplished these things.<br> So, what is it I tell prospective travel writers? The rules are simple enough: get your facts straight and tell us a story. Facts first: I was once taken to task by a reviewer who felt literature&#x201d; did not define my work. I was instead, he proclaimed, a high-level journalist,&#x201d; in the manner, I suppose, that certain mentally or physically challenged individuals function at a high level. In point of fact, I found the charge flattering. A high-level journalist is one whose facts are unassailable.<br> That is our job, but it goes further. To enter into the realm of literature or even aspire to it requires that the writer present a coherent narrative of value and insight. There is a story to be told, a bit of the world to be organized in a fashion that can make us laugh or cry, or preferably both.<br> The differences are easy enough to see. When I was an editor at a travel magazine, I could generally tell when a piece would be a storyless compendium of facts, like a ship&#x2019;s log. They usually began with the date, and a plane landing on a quaint runway somewhere all to hell and gone. It seemed to me that the writer had simply submitted his or her journal, and I knew that I&#x2019;d be reading facts and observations entirely devoid of story. It is story that elevates the material. By contrast, a manuscript that is, in essence, the traveler&#x2019;s journal is one in which the writer has failed to analyze the material. Reading these manuscripts is like those interminable nights spent at your neighbor&#x2019;s house viewing several hundred unedited slides of his latest vacation.<br> I should say that there were many well-written Internet pieces among the stories I was asked to review here. Those that were written on a daily basis reports from the field were often impressively literate, nimble, and highly immediate. But the writer had no time to contemplate the entirety of the experience. Such reports, written daily on a tight schedule, may have risen to a high-level journalism, but they necessarily lacked narrative. I have written such pieces myself and wish now that I could go back and write&#x201d; them, because there was often an overarching story that I wasn&#x2019;t aware existed until I studied my notes.<br><br>This volume contains a few pieces&#x201d; that might be termed adventure travel. Kevin Fedarko&#x2019;s piece on the Grand Canyon comes to mind. There are those who consider outdoor literature a separate genre. Not travel writing at all. I believe that writing about nature, or exploration or adventure in all its guises, can, in fact, be compelling and literate. This was not always the case in America. In 1975, I and several others were asked to come up with an idea for an outdoor&#x201d; magazine. We reviewed all potential competitors and found that with the exception of a magazine called Mountain Gazette outdoor writing was confined to what is called service articles: a canoeing magazine might tell its readers how best to paddle a canoe. Twelve times a year.<br> Adventure articles were the province of magazines with titles like Saga or Man&#x2019;s Adventure or Adventure for Men, and the stories themselves titled I Survived the Savage Coyotes of Montana&#x201d; seemed, well, subliterate and written to appeal to a barbershop clientele. Kira Salak proves here that adventure is not the sole province of men, and that an adventure can be not only exciting but also evocative, literate, and informative. Oh yeah, and true.<br> Back in 1975, other outdoor magazine startups, now defunct, were firmly based in an earnest ecological niche, and the writers for those sincere efforts tended to elucidate issues by shaking their fingers in the readers&#x2019; faces. Pieces consisted of facts devoid of story all wrapped around the idea that an ecological Armageddon was just around the corner, and it was your fault.<br> The magazine I was involved with did not have a particular horse to flog. Our idea simplicity itself was to produce a periodical that contained literate writing about the out-of-doors. This was considered a moronic idea by journalism pundits who explained, in critical articles, that people who went out-of-doors were, by their very nature, subliterate, knuckle- dragging mouth-breathers.<br> That was largely my fault, I think. Early on, I had argued that adventure could be part of the mix. My colleagues demurred. Adventure was in the realm of barbershop reading. My response was that outdoor and adventure literature is, in fact, American literature, and always has been. James Fenimore Cooper, Herman Melville, Faulkner, Thoreau, Hemingway were all outdoor writers of a sort. It is a great stain that runs through classic American literature. The stories in Adventure for Men did serve this tradition well.<br> So we had adventure stories in the new magazine, and we took a little heat for it. An unintended, but important, side effect was that we were also able to write about ecological issues, but in a story form that held the reader&#x2019;s interest and enlisted him or her in a conspiracy of caring. No finger shaking.<br> There is another sort of adventure included in this volume. You don&#x2019;t see a lot of erotica in travel writing. In fact, you don&#x2019;t see any. My friend, Don George, the global editor at Lonely Planet, once asked various writers to contribute to a book he wanted to call The Erotic Traveler. Few of us were able to dredge up a suitable story. Nobody wants to get naked in front of several hundred thousand strangers, for one thing. For another, sexual encounters between well-heeled travelers and impoverished people in developing countries feels . . . well, wrong.<br> This year, someone got it right, as you will see in Rolf Potts&#x2019;s story about Tantric yoga for dilettantes.<br> Other stories here literally take place in the writer&#x2019;s neighborhood, which validates several points I&#x2019;ve been trying to make. Several years ago, Bill Bryson made the point that travel writing is a forgiving genre: once you walk out the front door, you&#x2019;re traveling. And I have an ongoing preference: I&#x2019;d rather read a well-written piece a story about a picnic in the back yard than another addled account of someone&#x2019;s attempt to do cartwheels across the breadth of Turkmenistan.<br> More to the point: Ian Frazier&#x2019;s memoir about leaving home draws a picture of a midwestern town some forty years ago. Such stuff may be exotic to a person living in Japan, but it was very close to my own experience growing up in my own midwestern town. Despite my familiarity with the subject, the piece is so gracefully written, so spot-on accurate, that I felt that pleasurable prickly sensation that I believe academics call the shock of recognition.&#x201d; Meanwhile, Pico Iyer writes, charmingly, about his own neighborhood, which happens to be in Japan and is totally foreign to me. Both writers simply stepped out the front door: Frazier figuratively, Iyer literally.<br> I&#x2019;m sure some may argue that various pieces here are not precisely travel writing.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m thinking of Michael Paterniti&#x2019;s story, which does, indeed, take us to the Ukraine but is what many might consider a personality profile. The personality in question is what we used to call a trip&#x201d; in itself. The autho...</p><h2>Too Big (New York Review Children&#39;s Collection)</h2><p>The little hero of this tale has a shock of blond hair, a devoted dog, and a frisky cat, but today he has a problem, a big problem, in fact: he&#x2019;s just too big to do the things he wants to do.

And by the end of this collection, you'll define some commonly used phrases in an entirely different way. The understated "catch some air" and the whimsical "log some flight time" are climbers' euphemisms for falling, while "crater" refers to what happens when you log some flight time all the way to the ground. "Summiting," the term for reaching the top of a mountain, seems almost colorless in comparison. The various heroes, risk-takers, incompetents, and individualists Krakauer captures are more than colorful, whether they summit or not. The author is more interested in exploring the addiction of risk--the intensity of effort--than mere triumph. There's the mythical minimalist climber, John Gill, whose fame "rests entirely on assents less than thirty feet high," and the Burgess brothers--freewheeling, free-floating English twins who seem to make all the right decisions when it counts, and hence most often fail to reach the top. Of course, they are <i>alive</i>. Over these and other talented climbers hangs a malignant, endlessly creative nature--its <i>foehn</i> winds can make people crazy and its avalanches do far worse. <i>Eiger Dreams</i> is an adrenaline fest for the weary, an overdue examination of a stylish, brave subculture. As one of the heroes Krakauer outlines says of his occupation, "It's sort of like having fun, only different."No one writes about mountaineering and its attendant hardships and victories more brilliantly than Jon Krakauer. In this first collection of his finest work from such magazines as Outside and Smithsonian, Krakauer explores the subject from the unique and memorable perspective of one who has battled peaks like K2, Denali, Everest, and, of course, the Eiger. Always with a keen eye, an open heart, and a hunger for the ultimate experience, he gives us unerring portraits of the mountaineering experience.Yet Eiger Dreams is more about people than about rock and ice - people with that odd, sometimes maniacal obsession with mountain summits that sets them apart from other men and women. Here we meet Adrian the Romanian, determined to be the first of his countrymen to solo Denali; John Gill, climber not of great mountains but of house-sized boulders so difficult to surmount that even demanding alpine climbs seem easy; and many more. In the most intimate piece, "The Devils Thumb," Krakauer recounts his own near-fatal, ultimately triumphant struggle with solo-madness as he scales Alaska's Devils Thumb.Eiger Dreams is stirring, vivid writing about one of the most compelling and dangerous of all human pursuits.

Life is tough and cheerless for Billy Casper, a troubled teenager growing up in the small Yorkshire mining town of Barnsley. Treated as a failure at school, and unhappy at home, Billy discovers a new passion in life when he finds Kes, a kestrel hawk. Billy identifies with her silent strength and she inspires in him the trust and love that nothing else can, discovering through her the passion missing from his life. Barry Hines&#39;s acclaimed novel continues to reach new generations of teenagers and adults with its powerful story of survival in a tough, joyless world. Ken Loach&#39;s renowned film adaptation, Kes, has achieved cult status and in his new afterword Barry Hines discusses his work to adapt the novel into a screenplay, and reappraises the legacy of a book that has become a popular classic. Barry Hines (b. 1939) was born in the mining village of Hoyland Common, near Barnsley, South Yorkshire. Leaving Ecclesfield Grammar School without any qualifications, Hines worked as an apprentice mining surveyor for the National Coal Board before entering Loughborough Training College to study Physical Education. Working as a teacher in Hoyland Common, he wrote novels in the school library after work, later turning to writing full-time.

A first novel.</p><p>Oscar Wilde once said that the only real tragedy in life is getting what you want. Ben Bradford, the protagonist of Douglas Kennedy's new novel, <i>The Big Picture</i>, is living proof of that adage. At the start of Kennedy's novel, Ben Bradford would appear to have it all: a beautiful wife, a big suburban home, two kids and a partnership in a prestigious New York law firm. But Ben's heart lies neither with his family nor his career. Instead, he dreams of being a photographer, and when he discovers his wife is having an affair with the man next door--who happens to be a photographer--Ben snaps and commits an act that will commit <i>him</i> to a whole new way of life, forever. <p> Kennedy threads his tale of obsession, murder, and identity with themes that resonate strongly today: what compromises are worth making? What sacrifices require too much? <i>The Big Picture</i> is both a thriller and a cautionary tale concerning the complexities of modern life.</p>Douglas Kennedy is the author of the acclaimed novel THE DEAD HEART as well as three travel books.

After thoughtful and entertaining discussions of poetry and art and their relation to Enlightenment science, the party evolved into a lively, raucous evening. This legendary event would prove to be a highlight in the lives of these immortals.</p><p>A beautiful and profound work of extraordinary brilliance, <em>The Immortal Evening</em> regards the dinner as a lens through which to understand the lives and work of these legendary artists and to contemplate the immortality of genius.</p></p><p>Stanley Plumly (1939&#x2015;2019) authored ten books of poetry and four works of nonfiction, including Elegy Landscapes, Posthumous Keats, and The Immortal Evening. Winner of the Truman Capote Award and the Paterson Poetry Prize, among others, Plumly was Maryland's poet laureate from 2009 to 2018 and taught at the University of Maryland where he founded the graduate program in creative writing.&#x201c;Who but a poet could bring such vitality of imaginative insight to history that a night passed nearly 200 years ago could come back to vivid life? But more than re-creating one extraordinary gathering, Stanley Plumly knows what makes an evening truly immortal: located within those few hours that pass among extraordinary souls in heated conversation lurks the singular imprint of each man&#x2019;s history and the yet unseen map of time unspooling its fortunes ahead of each. Plumly offers us some outline of fate&#x2019;s thumbprint as it secretly presses itself down onto four lives, giving us that knowledge these men can sense but not yet see themselves. In doing so, he gives his readers the great gift of showing not only the intermingled yarn of unique lives as they weave together and pull apart&#x2015;of one evening as it reaches forward and backward into art&#x2019;s eternity&#x2015;but also a privileged glimpse into the inner life of the artist and the ongoing struggle of faith, ambition, devotion, vision that undergird not only the greatest works of art but also those that (so humanly) fall short of their lofty mark.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Dan Beachy-Quick</strong><br><br>&#x201c;In circling around Benjamin Haydon&#x2019;s dinner party in 1817, Stanley Plumly directs a beam of brilliant light into the mysteries of art and friendship. Haydon&#x2019;s own talent (though he misunderstood it) was for portraiture. Plumly has created portraits of Keats, Wordsworth, Lamb, and Haydon so sensitive and revelatory, one feels he must have known them and have attended the party. This book about the passion and heartbreak of art is, itself, a work of art, a majestic achievement.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Rosanna Warren</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Stanley Plumly takes a single dinner, one grand night, and spins it out into a dramatically detailed, compulsively readable, and surprisingly wide-reaching meditation on romantic art and poetry. This book may be as close as we will ever get to sitting at table with some of the nineteenth-century immortals.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Edward Hirsch</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Stanley Plumly&#x2019;s <em>The Immortal Evening</em> is a gateway to the Romantics, with the spotlight firmly on Keats, Haydon, and Wordsworth. I can&#x2019;t think of a more lively, thoughtful, or erudite introduction to them. Plumly&#x2019;s great gift is to bring their world to life through an act of intuitive sympathy that is the hallmark of a great creative writer, and which can be found nowhere else. <em>The Immortal Evening</em> is destined to become an essential companion to our study of Romanticism in exactly the same way as his earlier Posthumous Keats.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Duncan Wu</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Written with great eloquence and insight ... The colorful portrait [Plumly] paints is that of a select artistic fraternity, frequently contrary in their opinions and attitudes, who nevertheless knew that they were making a significant impact on the spirit of their age.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Deeply considered... an essay on mortality as much as immortality.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Michael Dirda, <em>Washington Post</em></strong></p><h2>The Substitute Teacher From The Black Lagoon</h2><p>A brand-new edition in the bestselling Black Lagoon series!THE SUBSTITUTE TEACHER FROM THE BLACK LAGOON is a brand-new edition in the bestselling Black Lagoon series!

Rowan's Bed-Wetting: A Guide for Parents (St. Martin's, 1974)--contains this stunningly negative statement: "The majority of children who develop the pattern of bed-wetting, however, do so in a desire to influence the family or social environment about them, as a response to anxiety or hostility, or as a means for challenging parental control." Even though this book is written by a layperson, its approach, layout, and factual information are far superior to Rowan's. Mack's excellent book is designed to be used by both parents and children. First, she discusses the medical and psychological aspects of enuresis and encourages parents to apply positive reinforcement. She follows this with a picture book for school-age children which uses imagery, repetition, and commonality to help children achieve nighttime bladder control. Recommended.<br><i>- K.E.

In 1966, Williamson realized a lifelong dream when he was chosen to illustrate a comic book version of Alex Raymond&#x2019;s <i>Flash Gordon</i>.

Published to accompany a major exhibition that opened at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, in early 1996.</p><p>That DeCarava was a painter and graphic artist before turning to photography does much to explain the strong lines, extraordinarily rich tonality, and dramatic exploitation of light in his photos. Their emotional charge, however, arises from the social choices DeCarava made for his career. He has expended nearly his entire professional effort upon New York City's black communities. He cherishes the people, places, and events in his pictures and developed early the means to express his affection. He shoots using only ambient light, then prints so as to coax light expressively out of very dark images or, less often, to delineate darker detail in very light ones. The grays in his black-and-white pictures are velvety and warm--qualities he occasionally enhances by purposely shooting out of focus or exposing long enough to show movement. Whether a picture's immediate subject is documentarily realistic or, as in a photo such as <i>Crushed Can</i>, an abstract form bodied forth in a concrete object, the work is charged with earthy mystery, like a prime Rembrandt painting or a late Michelangelo sculpture in which, because of the artist's rendering of light and mass, life seems to be springing off the canvas, out of the stone, like Adam from the earth on the day of his creation. Like one of his favorite portrait subjects, John Coltrane, DeCarava is one of the transcendently great American artists. <i>Ray Olson</i>This survey of a half-century of photographer Roy DeCarava's (b. 1919) drawings, serigraphs, and photographs accompanies a traveling exhibition. DeCarava, the first African American to win a Guggenheim Fellowship (in 1952), illustrated Langston Hughes's The Sweet Flypaper of Life (1955), yet the only previous monograph on his work is out of print. Here, his wife, art historian Sherry Turner DeCarava, provides a perceptive essay about his early life, his first drawings and serigraphs, and the emergence of his expressive, unsentimental, and sometimes abstract photographic style, which makes his work immediately recognizable. Galassi, chief curator of photography for the Museum of Modern Art, surveys DeCarava's career and influences and provides new information on one of the earliest photographic galleries in New York City, A Photographer's Gallery, opened by the DeCaravas in their home. The quality of the works reproduced here, which often focus on black life in New York City, is superb. Highly recommended for photography, black history, and music collections.?Kathleen Gail Collins, New York Transit Museum Archives, Brooklyn<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>In the Land of the Lawn Weenies: and Other Warped and Creepy Tales (Weenies Stories)</h2><p><p>Kids can be such monsters.

Let me tell you something: Fairies might look lovely on the outside, but inside they are ugly, real ugly. Fairies are mean and vicious. They've got teeth like tiny needles. One bite wouldn't hurt much. But I'm pretty sure they wouldn't stop at one; they'd keep biting and chewing until they hit something vital. Fairies aren't good news. I know. Let me tell you about my fairy in a jar.I'd been running around the backyard trying to catch fireflies with the net from this bug kit I'd gotten years ago. The kit was a birthday present from an aunt who had no idea what I liked. I might have used it once or twice, but mostly itjust sat at the back of my closet under a pile of other junk. I'd lost the collecting bottle that came with it, but I found an old jar and punched a couple of holes in the lid. Bugs probably didn't need much air, but it was fun banging away with a hammer and nail. Anyhow, I was swiping the net at some bugs because there was nothing on TV except reruns and all my friends were busy and I couldn't find anything else to do.I'd caught a couple fireflies and put them in the jar. The whole adventure was . getting boring pretty fast. I was just about to quit when I saw a flash under the birch tree at the back of the yard near the woods. Thinking about it later, I sort of remember that the flash was different. It was more glittery, almost a sparkle.I crept over and swung the net.<i>Thunk!</i> Something heavy hit the bottom. I jumped. I thought I'd caught a bat. My skin crawled at that idea. I fumbled the jar lid open and slammed the net down. I felt a solid plunk against the glass. <i>Got it</i>, I thought. I needed two tries to get the lid on right. The jar kept shaking in my hand. So did the lid.A bat. My very own bat. The guys would go wild when I showed it to them.I held the jar up to see my catch. Three fireflies were crawling around the sides. But that wasn't what grabbed my attention. There was something else crumpled on the bottom. It wasn't a bat--not even close. It wasn't an <i>it</i>, either. It was a she.She unfolded herself and rose slowly to her feet, shimmering in the light of the quarter moon. Shewas no more than five inches tall. Skinny. Long dark hair. Green dress. Wings. She looked down at her body, as if checking for injuries. The jar was still shaking in short jerks that made her stagger and fight for balance. She pressed her hands against the glass and stared straight at me. For an instant, so quick I thought at first it was my imagination, there was nothing in her gaze but pure hatred.Then she smiled.Maybe I should have smashed the jar against the tree. Maybe I should have smashed it and run--just run and run forever. "Maybe" isn't worth much--it's only a word. In a way, I understood how that kid at the playground must have felt last week when I punched him in the gut. Everything inside of me was stunned. I felt that my body had been filled with glue. I held the jar and stared at her.<i>"Let me go, kind sir."</i> Her voice was like bells and dreams and whispers in my mind.I grabbed the lid. I started to twist it loose, but that look of hate flashed across her face again. I knew. In that thousandth of a second, I knew I could never set her free. By then, I also knew I didn't want to set her free. She was mine. I had captured a prize no one else could even imagine.<i>"Wishes,"</i> she said. <i>"I can grant wishes."</i>That got my interest. I took my hand off the lid and held it out, palm up. "Show me. A thousand dollars. Right here." I wiggled my fingers.<i>"You have to free me first."</i>"I don't think so." I wasn't stupid. I wasn't going to fall for some sort of trick.<i>"That is the rule."</i> Her voice grew colder."I make the rules now." It felt good to say that.<i>"Please."</i>"No."Still staring at me, she flicked her hand out and grabbed one of the fireflies from the side of the jar.Still staring at me, she raised the struggling insect to her mouth.Still staring, she bit off the head of the firefly.I don't know if she kept staring after that. I looked away. But I squeezed the jar, as if to make sure the glass was strong enough to keep her trapped. It was one of those jars people put homemade stuff in. The lady next door had this wormy old apple tree. Each year she made applesauce for the whole neighborhood. Every house got a jar, tied with a red ribbon. No one ever eats it. We just toss out the whole thing, or dump the sauce and keep the jar. The glass felt solid. It would hold her.I took the jar up to my room, being careful that nobody saw it. I put it on the top shelf in my closet.The next morning, I almost convinced myself none of it had happened. Almost. But the jar was there. And she was there. At first I thought she was dead. She was crumpled on the bottom again. Then, as I saw her let out a shallow breath, I realized she was sleeping--sleeping or in some sort of suspended state. <i>Creature of the night.</i> I don't know where that phrase came from, but it ranthrough my head. I noticed something else. The bugs were gone--all three of them. <i>Bon appetit.</i>I shook the jar a bit, but she just slid around without waking. I could wait. She'd be up after dark. I was pretty sure of that. Somehow, some way, I was going to get a payoff from her.Sure enough, when I checked that night, she was awake, sitting on the bottom of the jar. "Good evening," I said, speaking quietly so nobody would hear me talking in my room.<i>"Set me free. I shall reward you with wonders beyond your imagining."</i> She looked up at me and smiled. A chill ran down my spine."Cut the babble and give me some details. What can you do?" I picked up the jar, holding the sides of the lid. Even protected by the glass, I didn't want to put my fingers too close to her.<i>"Whatever you wish."</i>I didn't believe her. Promises were easy to make. "Show me."<i>"Free me first."</i>I shook my head. It was a standoff, but I was the one with the power. She was mine. She would give me something valuable. She had no choice. I owned her now. "Think about it," I said, putting the jar back on the shelf. "Think of some way to buy your freedom. I'm sure you'll come up with an idea."She gave me that look again, and a flash of those teeth. I closed the closet door and left the room. The next day, we had the same conversation, and the same again on the day after. I wanted proof. She wanted freedom. But she wasweakening. I could see that. I knew she had to give me a reward sooner or later. I could wait. I was in charge.On the fifth day, she agreed to my request. "I <i>will transmute an object for you,"</i> she said. Her voice was thinner, barely louder than a thought."Transmute?"<i>"I will change its form. Give me carbon. I will make a diamond."</i>"A diamond? That's more like it." I wondered for a moment how I was going to sell a diamond. But that problem could wait. Right now, I needed some carbon. That was easy enough. Charcoal for the grill, that was carbon. So was the graphite in pencils. So were diamonds. They were all just different forms of carbon. I couldn't believe that something I learned in Mr. Chublie's stupid science class was actually worth knowing. Live and learn. But I wasn't about to try to stick a big hunk of charcoal in the jar. There was no way I was opening that lid, not even for a second. I wasn't falling for any of her tricks. As I looked around the room, I saw the answer right next to me.I yanked out my desk drawer and hunted around the sides and corners. "Got it." Perfect. I knew I had it in there--a whole pack of refills for my mechanical pencil. The best part was that they were thin enough to slip through the air-holes in the lid of the jar. I was planning to keep a nice, solid barrier between me and those teeth, thank you.She gathered the pieces of lead. <i>"This will take some time."</i>"I can wait."She sat staring at the slivers of carbon. I put the jar away for the night. In the morning, I rushed to the closet to see my first diamond. In my head, I'd already spent the money--a new bike, new sneakers, all the new video games. The guys were definitely going to envy me.But she wasn't finished. The pieces of lead were still there, though they looked smaller and shinier than before. <i>"It takes time,"</i> she said.I would have to be patient.<i>"It takes time,"</i> she warned again that evening.I waited. On the fourth night, she was done. <i>"Here."</i> She held up her hand. <i>"Take this and set me free.</i>""What are you trying to pull?" I almost smashed the jar. There was nothing more than the tiniest sparkle in her tiny hand. She had made a miniature diamond chip. It was worthless. My dreams of wealth turned pale and vanished.<i>"This is all I can give you. Take it and set me free. You made a bargain."</i>I was so disgusted, I just put the jar back in the closet and went to bed. Maybe I heard something that night. I can't remember. I'm too scared to really remember. But I remember the morning. Every second is burned into my brain.I got up. I walked to the closet. The door was open about an inch. I'd thought I'd closed it. I opened it all the way and reached for the jar. My hand stopped. My breath stopped. My heart almost stopped. There was a hole in the side ofthe jar. There was a round piece of glass on the shelf next to the jar. She was gone.<i>How?</i> Then I knew. The diamond. She'...</p><h2>Life on the Refrigerator Door</h2><p>Mom, I went to the store.

She lives in Saskatoon. </p><p>Web: alicekuipers.com</p><p>Facebook: Alice Kuipers</p><p>Twitter: @AliceKuipers</p>Kuipers's haunting debut unfolds like a flip book of half-drawn images too swiftly ended, a compilation of tantalizing notes posted on a refrigerator by a single working mom and Claire-bear, her wistful teen daughter. Bittersweet, funny and achingly real, the nameless mother (an overworked obstetrician) and bubbly Claire communicate through these notes instead of talking, e-mailing or text messaging. Missives range from the daughter's plainly impassioned (Hi MOM! (Who I never see anymore EVER!)) to her mother's soothing, tough-upper-lip responses written during her breast cancer treatment. Kuipers captures the anxiety surrounding tragedy and conveys the importance of fully experiencing life. Although the format has its limits (notably in character development and narrative momentum), Kuipers delivers a strong, emotional reminder about the importance of loved ones, even through times of unceasing complications and challenges. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Roosevelt, as commander in chief, statesman, and politician, must navigate a delicate balance between helping those in Europe--while remaining mindful of the forces of isolation both in the Congress and the country--and protecting the gains of the New Deal, upon which he has spent so much of his prestige and power.<br><br>Kenneth S. Davis draws vivid depictions of the lives, characters, and temperaments of the military and political personalities so paramount to the history of the time: Churchill, Stalin, de Gaulle, and Hitler; Generals Marshall, Eisenhower, and MacArthur; Admiral Darlan, Chiang Kai-shek, Charles Lindbergh, William Allen White, Joseph Kennedy, Averell Harriman, Harry Tru-man, Robert Murphy, Sidney Hillman, William Knud-sen, Cordell Hull, Henry Morgenthau, Henry Stimson, A. Philip Randolph, Wendell Willkie, and Henry Wallace.<br><br>The portrait of Henry Hopkins, who interacted with many of these personalities on behalf of Roosevelt, is woven into this history as the complex, interconnected relationship it was. Hopkins burnished the relationship between Churchill and Roosevelt and eased the way for their interactions with Stalin.<br><br>Another set of characters central to Roosevelt's life and finely drawn by the author includes Eleanor Roo-sevelt, Sara Roosevelt, Missy LeHand, Grace Tully, Princess Martha of Norway, and Daisy Suckley.<br><br>Integral to this history as well are the Argentina Conference, the Atlantic Charter and the beginnings of the United Nations, the Moscow Conference, lend-lease, the story of the building of the atomic bomb, Hitler's Final Solution and how Roosevelt and the State Department reacted to it, Pearl Harbor and war with Japan, the planning of Torch, and the murder of Admiral Darlan. All these stories intersect with the economic and social problems facing Roosevelt at home as the United States mobilizes for war.<br><br>The lessons and concerns of 1940-1943 as dissected in this book are still relevant to the problems and concerns of our own time. A recurrent theme is technology: Do people control technology, or does technology control people?<br><br>Kenneth Davis had the rare gift of writing history that reads with the immediacy of a novel; and though the outcome of this history is well known, the events and people depicted here keep the reader focused on an enthralling suspense story.</p><p>A biographer of <b>Eisenhower</b>, <b>Lindbergh</b>, and <b>Adlai Stevenson</b> as well as a novelist, Kenneth S.

It failed to do so, however, for everyone who listened to it or read it in the papers. There were critical and well-informed minds in which the promise raised questions of identity that, viewed in terms of the future now rising as black clouds out of Europe, out of Asia, to cast gloom over the Republic,<br>were both difficult to answer and profoundly disturbing.<br><br>Was this "Franklin Roosevelt" whom his listeners had "known a great many years" actually and wholly the Roosevelt upon whom now depended so much of the fate of America and, indeed, the world? Or was the "real" Franklin Roosevelt a man different in important ways, and perhaps contradictory ways, from his Hyde Park friends' perception of him? In either case, but especially in the latter, to what extent and in what ways would his remaining "just the same" be a boon for mankind, to what extent and in what ways a misfortune, in the "difficult days" to come?<br><br><b>II</b><br><br>The man popularly perceived, the man whose face at midnight had been cooled by a mild springlike breeze as it was imbued by ruddy torchlight, was a big, warm, friendly, compassionate man with an acute sense of justice and a strong commitment to it. Through all the fifty-seven years<br>of his life (he would be fifty-eight this coming January 30) he had been a lover of simple country living. He disliked cities, though his most solid political support came from urban areas, and had in the past, in public speech, more than hinted a belief that virtue, discouraged by the frenetic<br>artificiality of crowded streets, could come to its full flowering only amid green growing things in such landscapes as the one he saw this morning out his bedroom window. For though the green growth was now in autumn retreat at Hyde Park, the hardwoods leafless, the evergreens nearly<br>black, the fields and meadows gray and brown and swept by chill winds under a darkly lowering sky (the weather, he noted, had greatly changed since midnight)&#x2014;though this was so, and though the present melancholy of it was felt, the window-framed landscape of wide fields and wild-wooded<br>hills was yet seen through memory's eyes as a greenly living one. Through it, nourishing and ordering it, flowed the great theme-river of his life, the mighty Hudson, upon whose wide bosom he had spent many of his happiest youthful hours in sailboat and iceboat and from whose bank he and his devoted friend Louis Howe had launched the model sailboats they designed and built together during his long convalescence, as a middle-aged man, from near fatal illness. It now presented itself to his vision, beyond a fringe of treetop, as more lake than stream. A small inland sea. And it<br>was in fact both an active arm of the sea and an active contributor of water to the sea, for it was one of the longest estuaries on earth, as Roosevelt had learned as a boy. Already, as it made its slow curve around Crum Elbow, it sometimes tasted faintly of the salt of the sea that flowed into it, if meagerly, at high tide, and into which soon it must die. Such facts greatly interested, and were known to interest, the man whom his neighbors had long known. He collected them avidly and, his admiring neighbors would have said, they now richly furnished a mind remarkable for<br>its capacity.<br><br>Many of these neighbors knew, as we know, that his collecting of facts, like his collecting of stamps, old books, naval prints, and the like, had been a major part of the psychological strategy he had employed, to sustain his morale, in the long hard war he had waged&#x2014;much of it in this house, in this very room&#x2014;against the crippling effects of the polio that had struck him down in 1921, when he was thirty-nine. It was a war he had declared in the innermost recesses of his being, and to everyone around him, while he was yet wholly bedridden, unable even to sit erect. With an iron determination whose grimness he masked with smiling outward confidence, even gaiety, he had set out to conquer and destroy his affliction. He would walk again! He would walk unaided, without leg braces or crutches or canes! Alas, he never did. He became more mobile, less helpless physically, than had seemed possible to his doctors at the outset of his war, but no amount of willpower or arduous physical effort (he expended prodigious quantities of both) could regrow destroyed nerve tissue. In 1928, when his return to active political life forced him to suspend his recovery regimen after seven years of harsh effort, his legs yet remained nearly fleshless, hardly more than sticks of bone draped in wrinkled skin, and were almost totally unresponsive to his will. His public "walking" and "standing," in 1928 as in 1940, were difficult and often painful balancing acts on what were in effect stilts (steel rods locked around hips, knees, ankles), possible only if he leaned heavily on canes or had beside him a strong man whose arm he could grip. Nevertheless, his struggle had been far from fruitless. During it, as his neighbors knew, he had manifest and further developed an almost incredible fortitude, patience, and emotional self-control&#x2014;a self-mastery that was part and parcel of his mastery of other people.<br><br>Discerned by some of the more acute of those who observed him with close attention, though from a distance, was the fact that his very disability had become in his way of handling it a source, an instrument, a protector and preserver of personal power. As regards this last, it prevented risk-engendering importunities that he could not have avoided, save at the further and possibly greater political risk of giving offense, had he been able to move freely about and therefore compelled to mingle casually with other people on occasions and grounds not of his choosing. The compulsion was now all the other way: people must come to him, and they must come always, to some extent, at least, with formality&#x2014;that is, in accordance with formal rules whereby they were placed at an initial disadvantage insofar as their dealings with him were of an adversarial nature. This was true even in situations where his actual need for their support was considerably greater than theirs for his. For since they came as invited guests into his house, or by his permission into his office or onto other ground ruled by him, they came perforce under felt obligations and must<br>assume in some degree, willy-nilly, a supplicatory attitude.

Conjoined or (more precisely) fused with the self-mastery he had gained through his struggle to overcome it, his perceived handicap, in part by weakening in other people their inward resistance to his will, actually increased his persuasiveness and enhanced his ability to command through sheer force of personality. It commonly made these others want at the outset to please, emulate, and, if at all possible, agree with this man who demonstrated so much courage, strength of character, and optimistic confidence&#x2014;so much liking and concern for them personally, such sweetness of disposition&#x2014;under pressures that would have crushed an ordinary mortal into chronic depression and resentful dependency. Moreover there was a natural assumption on the part of people in general, an assumption abundantly encouraged by his careful management of his public image, that he had earned through his prolonged and terrible ordeal a compassionate living wisdom remarkable for its width and depth. He was therefore commonly deemed more likely to be right than his opponents were on issues concerning which the common view was not well informed. He might be so even on issues of which his own factual knowledge was meager: his "intuition" was famous, was encouraged by him so to be&#x2014;an ability, as it seemed, to dispense with logical process as he plunged with lightning swiftness into the heart of a difficult problem and discovered there its solution&#x2014;and though it was presumed that he had been born with this uncanny ability, it was further presumed that prolonged anguish and arduous struggle had sharpened and strengthened it.</p><h2>Last of the Donkey Pilgrims</h2><p>A heartwarming story of a man who journeys to the land of his people to discover what kind of man he is . . . and, more to the point, what kind of man he could become<br><br>Kevin O'Hara was a man who was at the crossroads of life.

The elderly patrons, biting at pipes and smelling of turf smoke, rolled in amusement.<br>"Ye're thinking of walking an ass about Ireland?" jawed Hugh Mannion from a high stool. "I have two at home that won't cross Derrane Bog!"<br>"Arragh, Hughie, now, be fair to your man," chimed Willie Cassidy from behind a hand of playing cards. "There'd only be the one ass that could circle the Ring of Ireland, and that'd be Johnny Rabbitt's jackass who swallowed the umbrella!"<br>I soothed my throat with a generous swallow of the black native Guinness, and sought refuge by the potbellied stove, flashing back to my inaugural pint here when I was seventeen. That long-ago summer, my younger brother Dermot and I were unwillingly sworn into the Celtic race in a drunken stupor. Now, on this cold winter night in 1979, thirteen years later, nothing had changed in this illustrious parish pub but the Harp calendar.<br>My uncle Vincent, to whom I had sketchily mentioned my plans, had warned that my "donkey proposal" would be greeted with ridicule by these age-old pensioners, who gathered every Friday evening at Rattigan's. But who else knew more about a donkey's strengths and limitations than themselves?<br>I took another gulp of the milk-warm stout, thinking back on that wondrous incident days earlier. Pedaling home to my grandmother's on the Knockcroghery Road, I was knocked off my bike like Saul from his horse when I saw a farmer smoothly tipping his donkey and cart down the road. "That's it," I gasped at the vision. "That's how I'm going to travel the whole of Ireland."<br>Now, taking a deep breath and another fortifying sip, I mustered the courage to speak above their merriment.<br>"But say, for instance, I was truly willing to go through with it. Could a donkey, a good one, travel the coast of Ireland? I'd take it easy, eight to ten miles a day, and I'd give myself eight months to travel the eighteen hundred miles."<br>Rheumy eyes glinted and glanced. The Yank wasn't having them on: he was dead serious. The house went silent. Playing cards were flattened. Miserable March rattled outside the panes. Pints were called for and collected as the old gentry of the parish circled their stools to gather their wisdom.<br>"A jackass, cut-jack, or a mare?" asked Mickey Owens, still eyeing me with suspicion.<br>"Never a jack," voiced Jack Rattigan, lifting the cap off his brow. "A jack would be braying sonnets in June, bugling day and night in August, and downright altogether mad in the snows of December."<br>"A cut-jack, then?" suggested Joe Hickey.<br>"A cut-jack is neither useful nor ornamental," mused Jim Tiernan. "A cut-jack has no heart. Nipped. Dry as polished glass. 'tis a mare the Yank would need, young and well-handled."<br>"The very thing," agreed the tall and scholarly Headmaster D'Alton. "A young mare sound of wind and limb, and a fine temperament. You wouldn't want her kicking the stars from the sky."<br>"A good mouth and square feet," added Hugh Mannion, "free of spavins, curbs, and sidebones. And she'd need to be well-shod with pony shoes and frost nails to cover those miles."<br>I stood among these wizened fellows--my mother's former schoolmates--nodding my head in agreement, but not having a blooming idea what they were on about.<br>"A double fistful of oats every morning would do her kindly," continued Willie Cassidy. "But don't go giving her a bucket of water after a good feed, or she'll cripple up and die with the gripe."<br>"Search Roscommon and Westmeath for your mare," offered Paddy Tiernan, "and don't go to any knackers or horse jobbers. With your Yankee accent, they'd sell you a mule without a tooth in its head."<br>"Better still," added Dan Madden, "if you're sincere in setting out on this caper, go see the horseman, Jimmy McDermott, in Kilteevan. If there's ever a mare that can circle Ireland, Jimmy Mac would be the one to find her."<br>"And keep a safe distance from the Spanish jacks," jabbed a smart aleck from the corner, "or your mare will be carrying extra baggage on the road home!"<br>The donkey seminar ended abruptly as the playing cards, itching in the hands of Willie Cassidy, were reshuffled and dealt again: the quarter-final round of "25" for an Easter turkey was at stake. Jim Tiernan, however, joined me by the stove. My grandmother's neighbor in the village of Ballincurry, he told me how his donkey could travel twenty Irish miles--twenty-five English miles--a day on a pinch of oats.<br>"An ass would go forever if you gave her her time," said old Jim, rubbing a plug of tobacco in his hands. "Pity is, too many farmers hurried and abused them. The only worry I see in you traipsing the world with a mare is that she could easily become homesick and lose heart. And when a mare loses heart, nothing will set her going again."<br>"What makes a mare lose heart?" I asked the affable man.<br>"'Tis easy enough, I'm afraid," he continued, packing his yellowed briar pipe with his thumb. "Mare asses worked a hard long day in Roscommon. But whether they were off to market with a sow, to the creamery with a can or two, to the bog for a cartload of turf, or to the fields to draw in the hay, they always knew they'd be home by nightfall to be fed and watered. Your mare won't have that luxury, for she'll be traveling the roads day after day, over mountain and bog, and at night be tethered in a different field or placed in some stinking byre. Nor will she be able to make any sense of your wanderings.<br>"I suppose a jack would be right for your journey if they weren't so ornery," he went on, lighting his pipe. "A jack is a common rogue, a rambler, but a mare likes her home. I heard a story years back of how a County Longford man sold his mare heavy in foal to a County Fermanagh man. The deal was settled over a jar of stout and the mare was boxed and carted up through Longford, Leitrim, and beyond the border town of Enniskillen. Fifty miles, if not more. Well, wouldn't you know, three days later this same Longford farmer was walking his fields, only to spot the sold mare feeding her downy foal. The poor creature had made good her escape and traveled fifty miles in two days to give birth on the third. Now, doesn't that give you some idea of their homing instincts?"<br>Of course, not everyone at Rattigan's was as helpful as Jim Tiernan. There was a scrum of old wags who brayed and whinnied throughout the seminar, asking one another if both my oars were cleaving the sea and other opprobrious remarks better left forgotten. But, all in all, it had been a fine evening. My proposed journey, however whimsical, now seemed at least plausible.<br>I sat on a wooden bench by the doorway, finishing my drink and tucking my pants into my socks for the bike ride home, when Hugh Mannion addressed the happy crowd, saying I'd be nothing short of a folk hero if I managed to circle Ireland with a donkey and cart.<br>"He'd be much like those wise men," he exclaimed, raising his bottle of barley wine, "who climbed Faerymount one clear night in June, all in hopes of catching the rising moon in a burlap bag!"<br>Everyone had a good laugh at that one, and they were still rolling when I left Rattigan's and mounted my bicycle for home.<br>On my three-mile spin back to Uncle Vincent's, I became so elated by visions of these donkey travels that I hopped off my bike and shouted up into the star-frosted night. But it was too early to go celebrating just yet. I hadn't a donkey yet nor the knowledge of what to do with one once I had it. And there were those donkeymen at Rattigan's, willing to wager their weekly pension check against any one ass completing the Ring of Ireland.<br>If this was true, would I have to set up relief stations along the coast--the proverbial Donkey Express? And was the distance of 1,800 miles--Boston to Amarillo in my country--fair for one donkey to travel?<br>Who was I trying to kid, anyway? I'm no Marco Polo. Not even a Cub Scout. I never toted tents on campouts or annual jamborees, never learned how to read a compass or light a fire with dry sticks. Neither Marlboro Man nor L.L. Bean mountaineer, I was not from that breed of men who tamed the American wilderness. Little wonder those cronies at Rattigan's enjoyed their chuckle, figuring I hadn't the strength to tie a double-knot in my sneakers, and then, to propose this preposterous expedition.<br>I hopped back on my bicycle, my wheels wobbling down the black country road. There were so many stones in my path: Could a donkey and cart handle the hills and water-crossings, navigate the cities, the Northern boundaries, elude the animal protection league, and avoid encounters with Tommies or the IRA? Would I be gunned down by some trigger-happy sectarian? But easy! Easy! No sense in becoming too anxious too soon.<br>I stopped to gather myself at the old millhouse in Cloonara where the stars gleamed in winter glory and the River Holywell grumbled through the quiet blackness. Was I really mad, as many at Rattigan's had thought? Who would ever know? But this one time in my life I wanted to leave all worldly concerns behind and embark on this journey with the dizzy abandon of an adventurous boy.<br>Or like the adolescent I'd been when I first came to Ireland with my parents in 1966, their first trip home since emigrating to America. They'd been in England till 1953, where I had been born, along with four siblings, and three more arrived after we moved to Massachusetts. "The Yanks," we called the latecomers.<br>Dermot and I had been the chosen pair for this long-awaited vacation, and when we arrived to our grandmother's at Ballincurry, our mother led us to the high-hedged fields of her old homestead. There, uncharacteristically, she took us each by the hand and spun us around, stopping to point out things with a trembling finger.<br>"There's the white stone where Mrs. Tiernan would sit and wait for us to come home from school with slices of rhubarb tart. Why, you've never tasted the like! And below, there, in the meadow of Coolrua, Aunt Bea kept her blue hens. Yes, blue hens! And look, boys, the fires smoldering in the bogs. Many a long, happy day I spent there gathering turf with your great-grandfather. And do you see Lough Ree? Headmaster Foley would tell us stories of how Vikings sailed their longships there on St. John's Eve a thousand years ago."<br>Dermot and I looked at her in awe. This wasn't the mom we knew back home in Pitts-field: a tired, worn mother of eight, living in a drafty duplex on Wilson Street. How sad to be brought up amongst the greenest fields, dotted with farmhouses of friends and kin, and to wind up hanging her laundry in a bare backyard where our landlord kept his collection of junked automobiles. Little wonder she was often blue, saving her dimes in a Skippy peanut-butter jar all those years for this short respite to Ireland.<br>"At your age, boys, I could gather two stacks of hay a day in Jamsie's Field," she continued, her face flushed, her voice young and vibrant. "And I'd deafen swarms of bees with a spoon and tin can in those trees beyond. Oh, and the call of the corncrake. How charming their chatter!"<br>She told us colorful stories that left us imagining what might have been if she had remained in Ireland and raised her family here, rather than leaving for England at age seventeen to commence her nurse's training there. And how different would we be? Would we have been great men with the cattle, Dermot and me? Would we handle horse and plow, and rest atop the headlands, breathing in the ethereal goodness of turned tillage?<br>As witness to my mother's awakening that summer of long ago, I felt a great unrest begin to stir in me. What homeland treasures lay buried, never to surface? What hidden springs were never tapped? What balm for the soul never unearthed?<br>Not that I hadn't been drawn to Ireland long before this first visit. When my mother had suffered low periods back in the States, she would often keep me home from grammar school. I'd do chores and watch the little ones, and then I'd play marbles on our braided rug in the front room while Mom sat sadly by the window, rereading letters from home. I'd beg her to share the contents, and in no time I knew all of Grannie Kelly's family and neighbors. After the letters were read, I was given the stamps from their envelopes--colorful stamps depicting a little stone hut named Gallarus, a seat of kings called "the Rock of Cashel," and a brown-cloaked monk penning a Psalter--which I'd carefully paste into my notebook.<br>When I asked my mother what she missed most about Ireland, she had said the people, because they were as wholesome as fresh linen on the line. I told her I was going to travel all of Ireland one day, and I'd know it as well as my marbles knew the frayed seams in our braided rug, and sometimes she would smile.<br>A few years later, Grannie Kelly herself came to America, and I was relieved of my duties. She stayed with us for eleven months, filling the house with lively chat, love and laughter. And stories, always stories. With the evening Rosary said and tea in her lap, she'd tell us tales with her lovely accent and mighty howl. "Aye, and poor Gummy Nertney coming off the mountain after a neighbor gave birth to triplets, you know, and Gummy saying, 'Have ye decided which one ye'll be keeping?'--as if talking about kittens, be God."<br>So here I was now, alone in the dark of an Irish night with a diadem of stars over my head, ready to reclaim my lost kingdom, determined to travel the roads in search of my heritage, to find some missing part of myself, to recapture an Irish childhood lost to emigration. Call me mad, but I had to embark on this crazy quest.<br>My cousin Noel Kelly was the only one awake at Uncle Vincent's when I walked the bicycle into the yard. Excitedly, I told him about my planned donkey tour, and how I had to see Jimmy McDermott the next evening in Kilteevan.<br>Noel, reading the paper at the kitchen table, looked up at me with one eye cocked. "How many pints did you have tonight?" he asked.<br>"Two."<br>"Two pints of Guinness," he chuckled, carrying himself off to bed. "Two pints of Guinness and you're out of your flipping mind."<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2004 by Kevin O'Hara</p><h2>The Big Bamboozle: 9/11 and the War on Terror</h2><p>From the perspective of a Boeing 767 captain and former &#34;special activities&#34; contract pilot, Philip Marshall straps the reader into the cockpits of hijacked commercial airliners to tell the story of the most sophisticated terrorist attack in history. Based on a comprehensive ten-year study into the murders of his fellow pilots on 9/11, he explains how hijackers, novice pilots at the controls of massive guided missiles, were able to beat United States Air Force fighters to iconic targets with advanced maneuvering, daring speeds and a kamikaze finish. But, as Marshall explains, the tactical plan was so precise that it rules out car-bombers and shoe-bombers known as al Qaeda, KSM and Osama bin Laden. So then, who was it? That&#39;s what you are about learn. Backed by official NTSB, FAA and black box recordings, Marshall finds the most capable and most documented group of conspirators buried deep within a Congressional Inquiry&#39;s report and retraces their work in gripping detail. Fasten your seatbelt--- the sad truth is that all of the solid evidence points to a dark collaboration between members of the Bush Administration and a covert group of Saudi government officials. This is a game changer that will finally set the record straight on the most horrific crime in US history. This book is a compilation of official reports that disputes the Bush Administration, the Bush Intelligence Community and the American media&#39;s account of the 9/11 attack. United States Senator Bob Graham&#39;s Congressional Joint Inquiry in 2002 revealed that Saudi Arabian Intelligence agents met the 9/11 hijackers in the Los Angeles in January of 2000, harbored them and led them to 18 months of flight training in Florida and Arizona. Marshall follows reports from FBI field agents that warned George W. Bush&#39;s Administration that a &#34;cadre of individuals of investigative interest were engaged in flight training&#34; in the Arizona desert in the spring of 2001. Marshall identifies three top federal investigators who complained that Dick Cheney obstructed justice by refusing access to suspects who supposedly confessed to the greatest crime in U.S. history. None of the federal investigators were ever allowed to verify the confession of Khalid Sheik Mohammed who had been water boarded over 180 times at Guantanamo detention facility. The book disputes the video and media confession of Osama bin Laden and points out that none of the accusations by the Bush Administration could be proved. Marshall asserts that the Saudi government was the true executioners of the 9/11 attack and framed their enemies while CIA special operations set up an elaborate decoy named Osama bin Laden to divert attention away from the Saudi operation. He follows the hijackers to flight training airports and finds that Saudi agents led the hijackers to the Arizona desert where Boeing 757 and Boeing 767 airliners were parked at a secluded CIA operated airport. The operators of the CIA airport were traced to suspicious insider stock trades on two airlines, United Airlines and American Airlines, the only two airlines used in the 9/11 attack. Marshall breaks down the tactical flight plan that was used by the hijackers and chronicles the actions of Condoleezza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld, Saudi Arabian Prince Bandar bin Sultan, Dick Cheney and George W. Bsuh to learn that their account of the attack was severely flawed. Three top investigators wrote that Dick Cheney had obstructed the investigation and redacted the involvement of the Saudi government agents who were employed in California by the Saudi Civil Aviation authority. The Congressional Inquiry reported that the Saudi agents had &#34;seemingly unlimited funding from Saudi Arabia&#34; and had traced the hijacker financial support to Prince Bandar through a Riggs Bank account. Finally Marshall chronicles the media trial that allowed Bush and Cheney to derail American Justice by trying the 9/11 case with media propaganda and away from the American federal court system.</p><p>Philip Marshall, a veteran airline captain and former government &#34;special activities&#34; contract pilot, has authored three books on Top Secret America, a group presently conducting business as the United States Intelligence Community. Beginning with his role in the 1980s as a Learjet captain first as part of a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) sting on Pablo Escobar, and later in the covert arming of the Nicaraguan Contras, Marshall has studied and written 30-years worth of covert government special activities and the revolving door of Wall Street tricksters, media moguls, and their well funded politicians. Marshall is the leading aviation expert on the September 11th attack, as well as a masterful storyteller. The Big Bamboozle (2012) is his second work to focus on the flight training and preparation of 9/11 hijackers&#39; after False Flag 911 was published in 2008. His first book, Lakefront Airport (2003) was a novel based on his experience as a government contract pilot during the Iran-Contra operation. Philip Marshall began his 20-year career as an airline pilot in 1985, flying first with Eastern Airlines and then with United. He holds captain ratings on the Boeing 727, 737, 747, 757 and 767. Born and raised in New Orleans, Marshall currently resides in California.</p><h2>Why Buildings Fall Down: How Structures Fail</h2><p>Once upon a time, seven wonders of the world stood tall and brilliant and, it must have seemed, would stand forever, impervious to time and gravity. Now only one remains--the pyramid at Khufu, in the Egyptian desert near Cairo. All of the others have fallen down.<br>Modern technologies, computerized designs, and new materials have minimized structural failures nearly to the vanishing point. Even so, we can learn from ancient as well as recent history. Why Buildings Fall Down chronicles the how and why of the most important and interesting structural failures in history and especially in the twentieth century.<br>Not even all of the pyramids are still with us. The Pyramid of Meidum has shed 2,500,000 tons of limestone and continues to disintegrate. Beginning there our authors, both world-renowned structural engineers, take us on a guided tour of enlightening structural failures--buildings of all kinds, from ancient domes like Istanbul's Hagia Sophia to the state of the art Hartford Civic Arena, from the man-caused destruction of the Parthenon to the earthquake damage of 1989 in Armenia and San Francisco, the Connecticut Thruway bridge collapse at Mianus, and one of the most fatal structural disasters in American history: the fall of the Hyatt Regency ballroom walkways in Kansas City.<br>Buildings have fallen throughout history whether made of wood, steel, reinforced concrete, or stone. But these failures do respect the laws of physics. All are the result of static load or dynamic forces, earthquakes, temperature changes, uneven settlements of the soil, or other unforeseen forces. A few are even due to natural phenomena that engineers and scientists are still unable to explain or predict.<br>The stories that make up Why Buildings Fall Down are, finally, very human ones, tales of the interaction of people and nature, of architects, engineers, builders, materials, and natural forces, all coming together in sometimes dramatic and always instructive ways in the places where we live and work and have our lives.</p><p>Matthys P.

He has been an adjunct professor at Columbia University and a Distinguished Professor at Pratt Institute and a lecturer at universities throughout the world.<br><br>Mario G. Salvadori was a structural engineer and professor of both civil engineering and architecture at Columbia University.Structural engineers Levy and Salvadori have written a well-paced, highly informative, nontechnical work describing failures in a variety of structures such as buildings, bridges, and dams. Salvadori wrote Why Buildings Stand Up (Norton, 1990), so this is a natural complement. The subject, somewhat grisly in nature, is presented here with respect for the tragedies involved, and yet with a lighthearted pursuit of the truth as to the cause of the failure. Analysis of the failure is discussed and recommendations for improvement are offered, but without the usual condescension hindsight allows. Profuse illustrations by Kevin Woest, well labeled and explained, and several appendixes aid access. An index (not seen) is provided, but no glossary. This fascinating book is easily accessible to laypersons. Highly recommended.<br><i>- Alex Hartmann, Bloomsburg Univ.

Truth be told, when I first started to teach the course, I used love as a pedagogical carrot. I knew that my students would be willing to put up with the agony of having to wade through an unusually difficult reading list as long as they got to talk about love. I called the course "On Love: Gender, Sexuality, Identity," confident that the combination of love, sex, gender, and self-identity would speak to young folks eager to find their place in the world.</p> <p>It worked! The course became immensely popular, drawing an audience from poetry majors to lacrosse players, from purple-haired film students to Gap-clad preppies. Best of all, the more I taught the course, the less love became a pretext for more "serious" topics. I came to realize that love is one of the most soul-sculpting experiences of human existence. It's never just a little piece of life. It gathers and cradles all of life in its embrace, touching the sum total of who we are. When we are lucky, it lends luster to the rest of our activities. When we are unlucky, it spurs us to higher levels of thoughtfulness.</p> <p>Either way, we can't fail. Love is a win-win endeavor, even if it doesn't always feel that we're winning. This is why I'm prepared to make a case for falling in love-why this is a book about the benefits of taking the plunge.</p> <p>One of the main obstacles to our ability to fully experience the power of love is that most of us have inherited some fairly rigid ideas about men, women, and romance. This is why I made gender such a central theme of my course. I wanted to show that there is a complexity to romance that exceeds stereotypical distinctions between men and women. Not surprisingly, this was the aspect of the course that most energized my students. I discovered that, deep down, many of them were just as annoyed by our culture's dominant outlook on gender as I was. They just didn't have the vocabulary to express their vexation. They sensed that something was wrong, but could not quite put their finger on the problem. My job was to help them do so.</p> <p>This is also what I'll try to do in this book, for I believe that many of our most basic frustrations about romance are, at bottom, frustrations about gender.</p> <p>You'll come to see that I'm not a huge fan of our current self-help culture. This culture insists that men and women are radically different. It tells women that to make romance work, they need to learn to interpret the male psyche. This is the first misconception I want to dispel. As a professor of gender studies, I can tell you that there's no such thing as the "male psyche." There's no toolbox of time-tested techniques for luring a man. If the pop psychology section of Barnes &amp; Noble is full of books that insist that such techniques exist, it's not because they actually work. It's because we live in a culture that is struggling to come to terms with a rapidly evolving landscape of gender; we live in a culture that finds it easier to insist that men and women originate from different planets than to admit that we need to adjust to a new order of things.</p> <p>This is a book for those who are tired of hearing that men and women dwell in two mismatched emotional universes. It's a book for those who suspect that there may be better ways to approach romance than the gender-specific advice of most relationship guides. If you're a woman who is repeatedly wondering what she's doing wrong with men, you're not alone. Most women I've talked to have asked themselves the same question at some point in their lives. This applies to mature, confident women as much as to young women who are still hovering at the threshold of their romantic lives. The main problem with our self-help culture is that it tends to perpetuate women's insecurity about this. It implies that women actually <i>are </i>doing something wrong with men. What I want to do in this book is to liberate you from this mentality. It's a huge drain on your energies. And ultimately it won't get you very far. This is why I'm keen to offer you some new ways of thinking about romance.</p></p><h2>The Good Old Days--They Were Terrible!</h2><p>This book explains why the &#34;good old days&#34; were only good for a priviledged few and why they were unrelentingly hard for most.

As a lawyer, he represented nearly every major star of his era, as well as the richest man in the world, Howard Hughes, for whom he served as adviser, confidant, and best friend.

In The Look of Love, Jennifer McKnight-Trontz provides a rollicking history of the covers and stories that have captivated millions of readers worldwide. More than 150 of the most sensational covers from this venerable if venal literary form are shown in glorious color, focusing on the period from 1940 to 1970, romance design&#39;s most fertile era. The Look of Love features artwork and excerpts from titles such as Passion Flower, Kept Woman, Rendezvous in Lisbon, and Jungle Nurse. Along the way, it brings attention to the pioneers of the romance novel: cover artists such as Barye Phillips and Robert Maguire, who helped define the look of paperbacks in general, and Harlequin, the grand dame of romance publishers, with more than 100 million novels sold each year. McKnight-Trontz reveals the themes that typify both the story lines and the covers--hospital romance, the rich and raunchy, royalty, tropical paradises, Westerns, &#34;taboo&#34; relationships, pirates and warriors, and love triangles--resulting in this definitive compendium of camp.

The novelist George Gissing remarked that the 1880s and 1890s were decades of sexual anarchy, when the notions of gender that governed sexual identity and behaviour were being constantly eroded. It was a time when the words &#34;feminism&#34; and &#34;homosexuality&#34; came into use, redefining accepted ideas of masculine and feminine, and a time when the &#34;emancipated woman&#34; was viewed as a threat to family stability. That was nearly 100 years ago, and in this book the author points out the similarity between that time and this time. The sexual abuse of children and the increasing frequency of rape; the censoring of art and the banning of pornography; anti-abortion campaigns and the AIDs epidemic - these late-20th-century crises are, the author suggests, comparable to their &#34;fin de siecle&#34; counterparts. Elaine Showalter is also the author of &#34;A Literature of Their Own: Women Writers from Bronte to Lessing&#34; and &#34;The Female Malady: Women, Madness, and English Culture, 1830 - 1980&#34;.</p><p>Elaine Showalter was born in Cambridge, Mass in 1941 and was educated at Bryn Mawr College and the University of California. From 1967 to 1984 she taught at English and Women&#39;s Studies at Rutger&#39;s University and is now Professor of English at Princeton University.A history of the sexes and the crises, themes, and problems associated with the battle for sexual supremacy and identity, this work draws striking cultural parallels between the end of the 19th century and the end of the 20th century. Showalter explores the history and attitudes toward homosexuality, unmarried men and women, the concepts of masculinity and femininity, sexual fears and fantasies, sexual surgery, and sexual epidemics as represented in psychological, medical, and literary texts, visual art, and film. Fascinating and provocative, this book reflects the realities of history repeating itself and the impact of gender crisis on culture.<br><i>- Jeris Cassel, Rutgers Univ.

Combining historical, social, and economic analysis with personal experiences of love and loss, Jacoby turns a caustic eye not only on the modern fiction that old age can be &#x201c;defied&#x201d; but also on the sentimental image of a past in which Americans supposedly revered their elders.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br><i>Never Say Die</i> unmasks the fallacies promoted by twenty-first-century hucksters of longevity&#x2014;including health gurus claiming that boomers can stay &#x201c;forever young&#x201d; if they only live right, self-promoting biomedical businessmen predicting that ninety may soon become the new fifty and that a &#x201c;cure&#x201d; for the &#x201c;disease&#x201d; of aging is just around the corner, and wishful thinkers asserting that older means wiser. <br>&nbsp;<br>The author offers powerful evidence that America has always been a &#x201c;youth culture&#x201d; and that the plight of the neglected old dates from the early years of the republic. Today, as the oldest boomers turn sixty-five, it is imperative for them to distinguish between marketing hype and realistic hope about what lies ahead for the more than 70 million Americans who will be beyond the traditional retirement age by 2030. This wide-ranging reappraisal examines the explosion of Alzheimer&#x2019;s cases, the uncertain economic future of aging boomers, the predicament of women who make up an overwhelming majority of the oldest&#x2014;and poorest&#x2014;old, and the illusion that we can control the way we age and die. <br>&nbsp;<br>Jacoby raises the fundamental question of whether living longer is a good thing unless it means living better. Her book speaks to Americans, whatever their age, who draw courage and hope from facing reality instead of embracing that oldest of delusions, the fountain of youth.</p></p><p><b>Susan Jacoby</b> is the author of nine books, most recently <i>The Age of American Unreason, Alger Hiss and the Battle for History, </i>and <i>Freethinkers: A History of American Secularism</i>.

Much of this propaganda is aimed at baby boomers now in their late forties, fifties, and early sixties, because marketers are betting that the boomer generation will spend almost anything on products that say &#x201c;Hell no, we won&#x2019;t go!&#x201d; to a traditionally defined old age. I too have read (and occasionally written) optimistic screeds on the joys and advan�tages of the new old age, also known as &#x201c;young old age,&#x201d; also known as &#x201c;successful aging.&#x201d; But I now regard the relentlessly positive vision promulgated by cheerleaders for the extension of longevity as more of an exhortation, even an ultimatum, than an evidence-based portrait of old age as it is today and is likely to remain for the huge baby boom generation. As the oldest boomers turn sixty-five, it is past time for a more critical and skeptical look at old age as it really is in America today, especially for the &#x201c;old old&#x201d;&#x2014;those in their ninth and tenth decades of life. When I told a forty-something colleague that I was writing a book about the myth of young old age, she asked how old <i>I </i>was (a question still considered impolite in most contexts). I told her I was sixty-three. &#x201c;Surely you don&#x2019;t think of that as old?&#x201d; she asked in a horrifi ed tone. Actually, being an American who came of age in the &#x201c;forever young&#x201d; decade, I do not usually think of myself as old. But when I recall how quickly the last two decades, packed with love and work, have sped by, I know how close eighty, or ninety, really is&#x2014;as distinct from whatever subjective notions I cherish about my own youthfulness. Old, in Amer�ica, always seems to be a decade or preferably two decades older than one&#x2019;s own age. The difference between forty and sixty is that, at sixty, the imaginative leap to old old age is not only possible but inescapable. <br>&nbsp;<br>The idea that there is a new kind of old age, experienced in a radi�cally different way from old age throughout history, is integral to the marketing of longevity. For who would want to live to be one hundred if, as individuals and as a society, we accepted or even suspected that the new old age, after a certain point, encompasses most of the vicissitudes of old-fashioned old age? There is a considerable amount of truth in the assertion that many old people today&#x2014;if they are in sound fi nancial shape, if they are in reasonably good health, and if they possess func�tioning brains&#x2014;can explore an array of possibilities that did not exist even a generation ago. &#x201c;If &#x201d; is the most important word in the preced�ing sentence. The idea that we can control the future by aggressively focusing on and taking care of ourselves is an article of faith for baby boomers. Yet in many instances, successful aging&#x2014;or the outward ap�pearance of successful aging&#x2014;means only that a person has managed to put on a happy face for the rest of the world; present an image of vigor and physical well-being even when bones are aching; smile even though a heart may be breaking with loss; do everything possible to conceal memory lapses; demonstrate a consistent willingness to try anything new; and scoff (with just the right, light touch of humor) at those mis�guided contemporaries who refuse to &#x201c;live in the present.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Here&#x2019;s what one cannot do and be considered a person who is aging successfully: complain about health problems to anyone younger; weep openly for a friend or lover who has been dead more than a month or two; admit to depression or loneliness; express nostalgia for the past (either personal or historical); or voice any fear of future dependency&#x2014; whether because of poor physical health, poor finances, or the worst scourge of advanced old age, Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease. American society also looks with suspicion on old people who demand to be left alone to deal with aging in their own way: one must look neither too needy for com�panionship nor too content with solitude to be considered a role model for healthy aging rather than a discontented geezer or crone. Successful aging awards are conferred only on those who have managed (often as much by biological good luck as effort) to avoid, or convince others that they have avoided, the arduous uphill fight that eventually consumes all who live too long to retain control over either the mundane or the important decisions of everyday life. It&#x2019;s great to be old&#x2014;as long as one does not manifest too many of the typical problems of advanced age. The reality evaded by propagandists for the new old age is that we all are capable of aging successfully&#x2014;until we aren&#x2019;t. <br>&nbsp;<br>I hope that this book about the genuine battles of growing old will provide support for all who draw their strength and courage from real�ity, however daunting that reality may be, rather than from platitudes about &#x201c;defying old age.&#x201d; This commonly used phrase in the annals of the so-called new old age fills me with rage, because the proximity of old age to death is not only undefiable but undeniable. Anger, by the way, is another emotion considered inappropriate in the old; the dubi�ous notion of the &#x201c;wisdom of old age&#x201d; rests on the belief that elders can, and should, transcend the passions, vaulting ambition, and com�petitiveness of their younger adult lives and arrive at some sort of peace that passeth all understanding. <br>&nbsp;<br>The capacity to negotiate between the past and the present, not tran�scendence of the emotions and desires that have made us who we are, is the proper definition of aging with dignity. The great Russian-born dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov, who once seemed to fl oat above stage and earth as the preeminent male classical ballet star of his generation, bravely called himself a &#x201c;dancing fossil&#x201d; on the <i>Today </i>show. Having just turned sixty, he described the role of the older dancer as that of &#x201c;a me�diator between your memories and your [current] abilities as a human skeleton.&#x201d; This unromantic description of successful aging is applicable not only to nature&#x2019;s blessed exceptions, who figure so prominently in most prescriptions for age-defying behavior, but to anyone whose in�tense desire for meaningful experience remains undiminished by a real�istic recognition of time&#x2019;s indelible, deepening imprint. The search for new, earthbound ways to express lifelong passions&#x2014;not to transcend them in some mythical metamorphosis that seems more akin to a heav�enly ascension&#x2014;demands the most arduous efforts from and offers the most rich rewards for every aging human skeleton. Anyone who has outlived his or her passions has lived too long. Wordsworth got it ex�actly right, at the tender age of thirty-seven, in his &#x201c;Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood&#x201d;: <i>O joy! That in our embers / Is something that doth live, / That nature yet remembers / What was so fugitive!&nbsp;</i></p></p><h2>When Darkness Comes (Guardians of Eternity, Book 1)</h2><p>When it is revealed that she is the Chalice, a mortal woman chosen to hold back the darkness, Abby Barlow is plunged into an epic battle between good and evil where her only hope for salvation is a seductive vampire named Dante.

Original. (A DreamWorks &amp; 20th Century Fox film, releasing July 12, 2002, directed by Sam Mendes, starring Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, &amp; Jude Law) (Suspense)</p><p>Max Allan Collins is the recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Private Eye Writers of America, and the author of many books, including Road to Perdition, which became the Oscar winning film, and the Quarry novels, the basis for the hit TV series on CinemaxReaders can be forgiven if they believe there&#x2019;s nothing more to be done with &#x201c;Road to Perdition,&#x201d; the murderous tale of a mob kingpin, his favored hit man and the lengths each was willing to go to protect his son. After all, we&#x2019;ve already seen three treatments of this gritty noir story. First there was the 1998 graphic novel written by Max Allan Collins with art by Richard Piers Rayner. Next came the 2002 Sam Mendes-directed film starring Tom Hanks and Paul Newman. And then came Collins&#x2019; novelization of the movie. But it turns out the publisher of the novelization chopped about 30,000 words from Collins&#x2019; text to keep it from straying from the film version. Now Brash Books, a publishing house founded by novelists Lee Goldberg and Joel Goldman, has restored the missing text and released the novel as Collins intended it. The result is a richer and more satisfying version of the tale, one that combines the swift pace of the graphic novel with the well-developed father-son relationships of Mendes&#x2019; movie &#x2014; and that includes both additional hard-boiled dialogue and more historical context for the Depression-era story set in Al Capone&#x2019;s Illinois. And Collins&#x2019; writing, always crisp and vividly visual, is at its best here in &#x201c;Road to Perdition: The New, Expanded Novel.&#x201d;</p><h2>Mallory on Strike (Baby-sitters Club)</h2><p>With a major writing assignment to complete, Mallory is suddenly not so patient with her seven brothers and sisters, whose noisy play sends Mallory searching for a room of her own</p><p></p><h2>Your First Quilt Book (or it should be!)</h2><p><p>If you haven't got a clue about quilting, then this is the book for you!

In this honest, unflinching, and powerful book, Robert Andrew Powell chronicles a season of soccer in this treacherous city just across the Rio Grande, and the moments of pain, longing, and redemption along the way. As he travels across Mexico with the team, Powell reflects on this struggling nation and its watchful neighbor to the north. This story is not just about sports, or even community, but the strength of humanity in a place where chaos reigns.</p></p><p><p>Robert Andrew Powell is the author of "We Own This Game" (Grove/Atlantic, 2003), a story of race, politics and football in Miami. The book was excerpted in <i>Sports Illustrated</i>; the magazine later named it one of the Best Books of 2003. His journalism has appeared in the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>New York Times Magazine</i>, <i>Play</i>, <i>Slate</i>, <i>Mother Jones</i>, <i>Inc.</i>, <i>5280</i>, <i>Sports Illustrated</i>, <i>Runner's World</i>, the Kansas City <i>Star</i>, on public radio's "This American Life with Ira Glass," and in the "Best American Sports Writing" anthology. He also produced a documentary film, "Year of the Bull," which first aired on Showtime. He has won a James Beard Award for his food writing and twice been a finalist for the Livingston Award. He lives in Miami.</p><p>&#x201c;[I]n this clear-eyed and humane book Powell has succeeded in introducing his readers to a truth behind the grim and monotonous headlines.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Boston Globe</i></p><p>&#x201c;Terrific. Fantastic. A hell of a book. In the best tradition of literary journalism, Robert Andrew Powell finds the story we'd missed in our own backyard, using the love of soccer to reveal the humanity that survives in hyper-violent Ciudad Ju�rez. This is the best sports non-fiction I've read in a long, long time.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Grant Wahl, New York Times bestselling author of The Beckham Experiment</i></p><p>&#x201c;To call <i>This Love Is Not For Cowards</i> a sports book does it an injustice. Powell tackles a subject that actually should matter to Americans: The bloody breakdown of civic life just over the U.S. border -- and the ways it can corrode even the most detached observer's soul. Daring, honest and wielding a pitch-perfect ear, he uses soccer to chart Juarez's ultra-violent anarchy the way the best correspondents chronicle war. He leaps into the devil's playground -- and reports the hell out of it.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>S.L. Price, senior writer, Sports Illustrated</i></p><p>&#x201c;The most dangerous game is believing in life. Robert Andrew Powell takes us into the most murderous city in the world, where a soccer team and its fans teach us how to live and why. This book will save your life by giving you life.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Charles Bowden, author of Murder City</i></p><p>&#x201c;Candid . . . Unsentimental and deeply humane.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>&#x201c;[A]n edgy, anecdotal view of a place where &#x2018;Murder is effectively legal'... Powell captures surreal feelings of beauty and desolation, exuberance and danger. Though the Indios fail and fail big, Powell succeeds brilliantly . . . An eye-opening and unforgettable account of a part of the world that, for all its notoriety, is effectively invisible.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Booklist (starred review)</i></p><p>&#x201c;Much like the soccer classic The Miracle of Castel di Sangro by Joe McGinniss, Powell's work explores not only the connection between an athletic team and its fans but also one city and one community's ability to simultaneously face conditions that destroy hope and try to restore faith, and in doing so he has written not only a great sports book but also a powerful treatise on civics and human nature.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p></p><h2>The Hidden Gardens of Kyoto</h2><p><em>ForeWord Magazine</em>'s BOOK OF THE YEAR Awards, Silver Medal Winner, Home &amp; Garden<br><br>Supreme examples of the art of Japanese gardens, not easily accessible to the public.<br><br><em>The Hidden Gardens of Kyoto</em> is the attractive sequel to <em>Landscapes for Small Spaces</em> by the same photographer, Katsuhiko Mizuno. In this new book, Mizuno introduces the gardens of Kyoto that are not easily accessible or are totally closed to the public.<br><br>Mizuno was born in Kyoto and has spent most of his life in this old capital, established in the eighth century. Kyoto is not susceptible to short-term fashions, and this rigidness can be seen in the way it has kept the tradition of garden art alive over the centuries in public and private spaces. Thanks to his familiarity with the city, Mizuno has been able to penetrate its hidden corners and capture the beauty of unknown gardens with his cameras.<br><br><em>The Hidden Gardens of Kyoto</em> displays more than fifty gardens, from private dwellings to the Imperial Palaces and Villas, temples, tea schools and shrines. The elements and structure of each garden are explained by Masaaki Ono, who studied under the greatest twentieth-century garden designer, Mirei Shigemori. Plans drawn by Ono also accompany some of the garden descriptions.<br><br>Some Japanese gardens are planned so as to be seen from one vantage point, but many are designed for viewing from multiple angles. In his previous book, Mizuno only showed us one aspect per garden, but this time we are given various views as we explore the stroll gardens or look down from the verandas of the buildings surrounding enclosed gardens. This three-dimensional approach will help both professional and amateur garden designers and landscape architects to understand the structure as well as the diverse vegetation used in one garden.</p><p>Supreme examples of the art of Japanese gardens, not easily accessible to the public.<br>KATSUHIKO MIZUNO, the photographer, born in Kyoto in 1941, graduated from Doshisha University and the Tokyo College of Photography. His camera has been focused on his historic home town since 1969. In 2000 he renovated a Kyoto townhouse said to date from the latter half of the Edo period, converting it into a museum housing his photographic works. He has published over 110 books, including the English-language <em>Landscapes for Small Spaces</em> (Kodansha International), which won a Gold Medal in the <em>Foreword</em> 2002 Book of the Year Awards.<br><br>MASAAKI ONO, the author, born in Nara in 1947, graduated from Doshisha University.

More braids. More patterns. More necklaces. More great tips for making and finishing beautiful braids. It&#39;s suitable for beginners and challenging enough for more experienced braiders. The book revisits the round braid (for beginners) and then pumps it up by adding seed beads and finishes without findings. The book includes the Laramie twist, the 16 bobbin Roundabout, a different round braid called the Top and Bottom Tango that lets you evenly space out beads and crystals, and the Color Tipped Swirl which puts an edge of color to a fabulous twist braid. If that weren&#39;t enough, the book then tells you how to turn these great braids into beautiful necklaces. Fun, elegant, artistic, great for all ages.</p><p>Karen DeSousa is well known for her Accent On: series of beaded ornament cover books. But when she discovered kumihimo she knew this way the perfect way to marry the beauty of textiles with the joy of beading. She travels all over the US teaching kumihimo and sharing her modernization of this ancient craft. In her books, as well as on her travels, she uses necklaces to show the versatility of braids. This book is the answer to the question everyone asks. &#34;How did you do that?&#34; Karen can be reached at Kumihimo To Go and Accent Bead Design.</p><h2>Tinker</h2><p>When a pack of wargs chases an Elven noble into her Pittsburgh junkyard on the edge of elven lands, Tinker, a genius female inventor, is forced to take on the Elven court, the NSA, the Elven Interdimensional Agency, technology smugglers, and a Xenobiologist in order to experience her first real date.</p><p>John W. Campbell Award Winner&nbsp;<b>Wen Spencer</b>&nbsp;resides in paradise in Hilo, Hawaii with two volcanoes overlooking her home. According to Spencer, she lives with "my Dalai Lama-like husband, my autistic teenage son, and two cats (one of which is recovering from mental illness).&nbsp; All of which makes for very odd home life at times." Spencer's love of Japanese anime and manga flavors her writing. Her novel&nbsp;<i>Tinker</i>&nbsp;won the 2003 Sapphire Award for Best Science Fiction Romance and was a finalist for the&nbsp;<i>Romantic Times</i>&nbsp;Reviewers' Choice Award for Fantasy Novel. Her&nbsp;<i>Wolf Who Rules</i>&nbsp;was a Top Pick by&nbsp;<i>Romantic Times</i>&nbsp;and given their top rating of four and a half stars.&nbsp; Other Baen books include&nbsp;<i>Endless Blue&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Eight Million Gods.</i>&nbsp;The Elfhome series includes&nbsp;<i>Tinker, Wolf Who Rules,&nbsp;</i><i>Elfhome, &nbsp;Wood Sprites&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Project Elfhome.</i>Wit and intelligence inform this off-beat, tongue-in-cheek fantasy from Spencer (Alien Taste, etc.), set in near-future Pittsburgh-or rather, the part of Pittsburgh that's been translated to the Faerie world of Elfhome by a faulty hyperphase gate created by the Chinese. After 18-year-old tech genius Tinker saves Windwolf, the elven governor of North America on Elfhome, from a pack of nasty wargs, Windwolf in gratitude turns her into an elf and makes her his consort. In her new and important position, Tinker becomes the target for a conspiracy of humans, elves and oni (Japanese demons that control their own part of Faerie) who are trying to build another gate for use in conquering Earth and Elfhome. Furious action, including a memorable car chase, good characterization, playful eroticism and well-developed folklore all help lift this well above the fantasy average. The routine jacket art, of an elven biological dirigible, probably won't help, but Buffy fans should find a lot to like in the book's resourceful heroine. FYI: Spencer has won the 2003 John W. Campbell Best New Writer Award.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Glory Game: How the 1958 NFL Championship Changed Football Forever</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Frank Gifford brings the contest so alive that you find yourself almost wondering, 50 years later, how it will turn out in the end.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>The Glory Game </i>recreates in breathtaking detail the 1958 National Football League Championship Game between the New York Giants and the Baltimore Colts, which many football fans feel was &#x201c;The Greatest Game Ever Played.&#x201d; This first-hand, field level, &#x201c;behind-the-helmet&#x201d; account by ex-Giant Hall of Famer and longtime &#x201c;Monday Night Football&#x201d; broadcaster Frank Gifford brings back to life all the sights and sounds of the momentous contest that changed football forever, and offers vivid, indelible portraits of the legendary players&#x2014;including Sam Huff, Andy Robustelli, Art Donovan, Lenny Moore, and Raymond Berry.

When his New York Giants played the Baltimore Colts for the league championship that year, it became the single most memorable contest in the history of professional football. Broadcast to an audience of millions, it was the first title game ever to go into sudden-death overtime. Its drama, excitement, and controversy riveted the nation and helped propel football to the forefront of the American sports landscape.</p><p>Now, to mark the fiftieth anniversary of "The Greatest Game Ever Played," New York Giants Hall of Famer and longtime television analyst Frank Gifford provides an inside-the-helmet account that will take its place in the annals of sports literature. Drawing on the poignant and humorous memories of every living player from the game&#x2014;including fellow Hall of Famers Sam Huff, Andy Robustelli, Art Donovan, Lenny Moore, and Raymond Berry&#x2014;as well as the author's own experiences and reflections, The Glory Game captures a magnificent moment in American sports history. It is the story of two very different cities and teams, filled with the joy, the disappointment, and the eternal pride of a day that will forever symbolize all that is great about sports.</p><p>Told with gripping immediacy, <em>The Glory Game</em> is an indelible portrait of the NFL's most transcendent hours&#x2014;a winter version of The Boys of Summer, told by one of football's true legends.</p><p>A New York Giant for twelve seasons, Frank Gifford received the NFL's Most Valuable Player Award in 1956 and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1977.

She resides in Boston.Ages 2-5. This board book has all the jollity and mischief of the original 1989 picture book. The adventures begin with one hungry monster beneath the bed, ready to be fed. Then two monsters chew up sneakers, and so on, up to 10. A young boy tries to keep his mischievous guests under control, but it's a losing battle as they make their way through the house in search of food. Rollicking rhymes describe the action as the little dickenses slide down banisters, swing from chandeliers, and wreak havoc in the kitchen. They won't be appeased until all 10 are seated at the table being served by the boy--one jug of juice, two loaves of bread, etc. The boy's exasperation is clearly evident in the comical illustrations, which are just quirky enough to keep everything from being too cute. <i>Shelley Townsend Hudson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

We &#39;moderns&#39; can use the sixty-four hexagrams found in the I Ching as a predictive tool to enhance our lives and reconcile our spiritual and physical selves. When one consults the I Ching, the hexagram gives the general background of the situation, while the lines indicate the correct way in which to handle the specific circumstance. Master Ni recommends using Cassia Tora or &#39;wise decision&#39; casting seeds as a simple way to make divinations. The seeds are carefully dropped on a piece of paper and the hexagram they create gives us a response to our very important questions. As Master Ni says, &#34;There is no reason to distrust or fear the I Ching. It is always a faithful, trustworthy friend.&#34; Some of our visitors have told us that Master Ni&#39;s I Ching has led them in exciting directions they had never before considered -- one of our most popular books.</p><p></p><h2>Patterns That Connect: Social Symbolism in Ancient &amp; Tribal Art</h2><p>The American art historian, Carl Schuster (1904-1969), discovered a set of patterns designed by ancient peoples to illustrate their ideas about kinship. They tattooed and painted such &#34;statements&#34; on their bodies and clothing, and carved them on tools, game boards, pots, ceremonial objects, coins and other items, and carried these with them wherever they went. Through broad comparative study, Schuster decoded this iconography, which lasted over 10,000 years, crossed continents, and outlived most of the cultures that sheltered it. Having spent more than three decades gathering evidence for his study, Schuster delayed publication while he searched for more. This book, by his colleague Edmund Carpenter, distils his research to a single volume.</p><p>Edmund Carpenter (b.1922) taught anthropology at the univeristy of Toronto, California, &amp; Harvard.American art historian Schuster (1904- 1969) crisscrossed the world, gathering ancient and tribal art and identifying motifs and archetypal patterns that show a remarkable continuity across cultures and eras. For example, equating the image of a tree with the branching of the human race dates back at least to the Upper Paleolithic and finds expression in anthropomorphic "Y-posts," often with a carved human head at the end of each branch, from Siberia, Hawaii, New Guinea and Mali. Carpenter, an anthropologist, has distilled the work of Schuster, his former colleague, into a single, gracefully written volume, an important cross-cultural survey and a cornucopia of discoveries and insights for art historians, anthropologists, students of myths, religion, folklore and symbolism. Elegantly decked with 1023 illustrations, the study uncovers often astonishing similarities in labyrinths and cosmic drawings from Crete to Finland; in village layouts mirroring creation myths of the Winnebago of Wisconsin and the Solomon Islanders; and in mosaic garments, body and hand decorations, sculpted figurines, robes, carved stones and children's games from around the world. <p></p><p>Copyright 1996 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Quick &amp; Easy Tsukemono: Japanese Pickling Recipes</h2><p>Among the many authentic flavors of Japan, tsukemono, or pickled vegetables, has been a must for everyday meals and with tea.

Katherine lives in Vermont.In 1843, three years after her father abandons his failing Vermont farm, 10-year-old Lyddie and her younger brother Charles are hired out as servants, while Mama and the two youngest children go off to live with relatives. After spending a grueling year working in a tavern, Lyddie flees to Lowell, Mass., in hopes of finding a better job that will provide enough income to pay off farm debts and allow the family to be reunited. Life continues to be a struggle after she is employed in a cloth factory, but Lyddie finds refuge from wretched working conditions by burying herself in books. Learning that she cannot return home--the family farm has been sold to Quaker neighbors--the girl is seized by a burning desire to gain independence by attending college. Readers will sympathize with Lyddie's hardships and admire her determination to create a better life for herself. Paterson ( The Tale of the Mandarin Ducks ) clearly depicts the effects of poverty during the 19th century, focusing on the plight of factory workers enslaved by their dismal jobs.

Pop-ups are grouped by type&#x2014;box or triangle&#x2014;and as the chapters progress, the techniques are combined and layered for more dramatic effects.

It introduces the subject by describing how pop-ups move, and what tools and materials are needed for their creation. Readers who have limited 3-dimensional design experience will appreciate the interactive, hands-on approach adapted by the author, who has taught the subject to people of all ages. Starting with the simplest cut-and-fold box and triangle forms, each project builds on the prior one in developing a knowledge base of pop-up formats. The book is filled with full-color photos of finished projects, sample ideas, and drawings of each step of the construction process. The book is hard-bound, with a matte varnish on the cover that resists dirt and moisture, and an inner spiral binding that allows the book to lie open flat while in use as an instruction manual.I have been teaching people how to make pop-ups for the past twenty years, and still enjoy the process. There is magic in the transformation between a flat page or card and opening it to reveal a dimensional form. Students are transfixed by the discovery that they can create this magic by designing their own pop-ups. It&#39;s my hope that this first volume of &#34;The Pocket Paper Engineer,&#34; along with the volumes to follow, will serve as helpful guides to a truly wonderful artform.</p><h2>The Complete Works of Marcel Duchamp (2 Volumes in 1)</h2><p>&#34;To be a painter for the sake of being a painter was never the ultimate aim of my life.

When Gabrielle Buffet discovered Duchamp&#39;s Rotoreliefs, she emphasized this point further: &#34;Duchamp&#39;s aim was to primarily to modify all plastic matter, to reject once and for all from his working arsenal all the traditional tools and equipment (tubes of paint, canvas, and brushes); to obtain the effect by mechanical means instead of through the expression of personal dynamism inherent in a particular individuality; to substitute technical value for expressive value&#34;.</p><p></p><h2>The Magic Woodland Trilogy: The Stream That Stood Still (Lions)</h2><p>The Stream That Stood Still</p><p></p><h2>A Treasury of American Horror Stories</h2><p>Gathers horror stories by Bierce, Bloch, Matheson, Lovecraft, King, Strieber, Lanier, and Derleth set in all fifty states and the District of Columbia</p><p></p><h2>The Bone Clocks: A Novel</h2><p><p>&#x201c;The novelist who&#x2019;s been showing us the future of fiction&#x201d; (The Washington Post), David Mitchell delivers a kaleidoscopic, serpentine masterpiece that navigates between characters, eras, and realms of possibility to weave its astonishing spell.<br>&nbsp;<br>An eloquent conjurer of intricate, interconnected tales, a genre-bending daredevil, and a master prose stylist&#x2014;David Mitchell has outdone himself.

This is a feast of a book&#x2014;perhaps the author&#x2019;s best to date&#x2014;a saga that spans decades, characters, genres, and events from Mitchell's other novels. The structure is most similar to <i>Cloud Atlas</i>, with <i>The Bone Clocks</i> pivoting around a central character: Holly Sykes. Each chapter/novella is narrated from the perspective of an intersecting character, with settings ranging from England in the 80s to the apocalyptic future. Each story could stand alone as a work of genius, as they slowly build on Holly&#x2019;s unwitting role in a war between two groups with psychic powers, culminating in a thrilling showdown reminiscent of the best of Stephen King. Taken together this is a hugely entertaining page-turner, an operatic fantasy, and an often heartbreaking meditation on mortality.

As Sadie chooses from among the patchwork of hand-stitched names of generations of relatives, Grandma tells story after story &#x2013; stories of hog-riding and hornets and Grandma&#x2019;s own wedding. Then one summer day, a fierce storm comes on too quickly to get the washing off the line, and the quilt is blown away. That night, Sadie worries that more than just the quilt has disappeared, until Grandma shows her that all her favorite names and stories are more a part of Sadie than she knows. <br><br>Phyllis Root&#x2019;s loving tribute to a bedtime ritual from her own childhood and Margot Apple&#x2019;s intricate illustrations bring the story of Sadie and the name quilt to the page with just the right touch of humor and heart.&nbsp;<i>The Name Quilt</i> is a 2004 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.</p><p>Phyllis Root is the author of more than twenty books for children, including <i>Grandmother Winter</i> and <i>Rattletrap Car</i>.

She lives in Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts.<br>PreS-Gr. 1. Each night when Sadie goes to bed at Grandma's, she fingers the patchwork quilt on her bed, chooses a name embroidered there, and listens to her grandmother tell a story about that relative. One day a fierce wind tears shingles off the roof and blows the quilt off the clothesline. That night Sadie is tearful over losing the quilt, but she remembers name after name, and Grandma tells her story after story. The beloved quilt may be gone, but the family is still there. In the end, Grandma and Sadie make a new quilt, one with Sadie's name in the middle. In the artwork, as in the text of this warm comforting book, quilts become more than just bedcovers; they are personal keepsakes, reminders of family history, and colorful backgrounds for the characters' lives. Though warm, sunlit colors predominate in the illustrations, one particularly effective double-page spread uses darker shades to re-create the feeling of an approaching storm with swirling winds, driving rain, and the suggestion of a tornado in the distance. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The night was almost a navy blue, with so many stars overhead it would be impossible to count them. The moon was rising, a beautiful half-crescent of shining light. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s perfection. Everything I dreamed of.&#x201d;</p><p>Her wedding night. She&#x2019;d dreamt of it for so long. At last, this was the evening she&#x2019;d waited for, and the weather was cooperating, just as if it knew she was marrying the man of her dreams.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got to get you ready, Gabby,&#x201d; Joie answered. &#x201c;Come back here. I need to make certain you have everything you need and give you the &#x2018;talk.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>Gabrielle turned back with a short laugh. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m marrying Gary, Joie, the love of my life. I certainly don&#x2019;t need the &#x2018;talk.&#x2019; I love Gary Jansen with every breath in my body,&#x201d; she whispered, as her sister smoothed a hand down the filmy ivory and lace gown and stepped back to survey her handiwork.</p><p>&#x201c;Daratrazanoff,&#x201d; Joie corrected, a hint of worry in her voice. &#x201c;You still persist in acting as if you&#x2019;re human, Gabrielle. You aren&#x2019;t. Neither is Gary. Both of you are fully Carpathian. When Gary rose Carpathian, he rose as a true Daratrazanoff. He&#x2019;s from one of the most powerful lineages the Carpathian people have. You can&#x2019;t pretend he isn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s still Gary,&#x201d; Gabrielle protested gently. She took both of her sister&#x2019;s hands in hers. &#x201c;Be happy for me. Truly, I&#x2019;ve never been happier than this night. We waited so long to be together.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am happy for you,&#x201d; Joie said immediately, smiling at her sister. &#x201c;You look so beautiful. Like a princess.&#x201d;</p><p>Gabrielle looked at herself in the mirror. Her dress was exactly right. The perfect fit, a lovely fall to her ankles, swirling around her so that she appeared to be ethereal. She loved the square lace neckline and the fitted bodice showing off her small waist. She was tall enough to pull off elegant, and the gown did just that.</p><p>Joie didn&#x2019;t understand. None of them did. Only Gary. He knew. He saw inside of her. Way down deep where no one else had ever looked.</p><p>&#x201c;Joie, I&#x2019;m not like you or Jubal,&#x201d; she admitted, referring to her brother. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a woman who craves adventure. I&#x2019;m not a warrior who wants to go fight the injustices of the world. I&#x2019;m just Gabrielle, no one special, and I like my life simple. Peaceful. I like to sing when I wake up and hum all day long. I like picnics. Horses. Galloping across the fields and jumping over tree trunks and streams. I love sitting on a porch swing and talking quietly with someone I love. That someone is Gary.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, Gabby.&#x201d; Joie put her arms around Gabrielle. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t realize you&#x2019;ve been so unhappy. You have, haven&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>Gabrielle hugged Joie back, feeling lucky to have a sister and brother who loved her so much. She felt their love at all times. Their support. More than anything, she wanted Joie&#x2019;s support now in the biggest moment of her life.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t fit in this world, Joie,&#x201d; she said gently, trying to find a way to carefully explain. Joie pulled back and looked at her with liquid eyes. Gabrielle&#x2019;s heart beat louder. She didn&#x2019;t want to hurt her sister, but she wanted to be honest. &#x201c;I like to observe people from a distance, not be in the middle of some kind of crazy battle between vampires and shifters. I didn&#x2019;t even know there were such things as shifters or vampires in the world. Carpathians. Lycans. Mages. Jaguars. It&#x2019;s all crazy, like a mad nightmare, Joie. Violence and war aren&#x2019;t big on my agenda. In fact, the entire Carpathian way of life is totally foreign to my nature.&#x201d;</p><p>She had, thankfully, never heard of Carpathians when she was growing up. And she&#x2019;d always thought vampires were a myth. She still wished she thought that. Carpathians never killed for blood, but they slept in the rejuvenating ground, couldn&#x2019;t be in the sunlight, and existed on blood. They hunted the vampires who lived to kill their victims.</p><p>Gabrielle gave a little shiver. She&#x2019;d had enough of battles. Of wars. Of seeing someone she loved&#x2014;such as Gary&#x2014;nearly lose his life when it wasn&#x2019;t even his fight. She had nearly lost him. Gregori had converted him, bringing him fully into the Carpathian world&#x2014;as if they hadn&#x2019;t already brought him there.</p><p>Gary had somehow become an integral part of Carpathian life, so essential to them that even the prince sought his opinion on matters Carpathian. Gregori, second to the prince, was always with Gary now. It wasn&#x2019;t as if Gary was born a Daratrazanoff. He was born Gary Jansen, a genius, off the charts intelligent, a tall, thin reed of a man with glasses and a thirst for knowledge. A geek. Like her.</p><p>Now he was a tall, completely filled out, walking warrior. He went into battles without flinching. Even before Gregori had converted him he had. She&#x2019;d watched him slowly change from her nerdy geek to a completely different man as the Carpathians put more and more demands on him.</p><p>Joie moved to a chair as if Gabrielle was delivering a terrible blow, and she probably was. She hadn&#x2019;t told anyone but Gary her true feelings. Her beloved Gary. He was quiet and solid. He could always, <i>always</i>, be counted on. Everyone counted on him, but especially Gabrielle.</p><p>She kept trying to make her sister understand. &#x201c;Joie, you and Jubal belong in the Carpathian world. I don&#x2019;t. I don&#x2019;t even want to be here. Not anymore.&#x201d;</p><p>Joie inhaled sharply. &#x201c;Gabby&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Gabrielle shook her head. This had to be said. She wanted Joie to understand just what Gary meant to her. What he&#x2019;d been for her in the past and what he would be in her future. &#x201c;I hope, after tonight, after I marry Gary, we&#x2019;ll go away together and live in a beautiful little house. Nothing big. Nothing fancy. Just small and snug and filled with love. That&#x2019;s it. That&#x2019;s my dream. Gary and my little house tucked away someplace where there are no such things as vampires and women carry their children to full term and give birth to healthy, happy babies. No wars. Just peace and happiness.&#x201d;</p><p>There, she&#x2019;d said it. That was the strict truth, and Joie needed to know how she truly felt.</p><p>Joie&#x2019;s eyebrows came together as she frowned. &#x201c;You mean you want to move away from here? Where your laboratory is set up? You love working here. You want to move away from the Carpathian Mountains? From the prince? From Gregori?&#x201d;</p><p>Gabrielle straightened her shoulders and lifted her chin. &#x201c;<i>Especially</i> away from the prince and Gregori.&#x201d;</p><p>Joie shook her head, looking shocked.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t belong in the Carpathian world, I just don&#x2019;t. Only Gary seems to understand that about me. He doesn&#x2019;t mind that I&#x2019;m not a fierce warrior woman. The thing is, Joie, I don&#x2019;t <i>want</i> to be different. I&#x2019;m a book person. I like to live quietly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Gabrielle, you are so far off track about yourself and Gary. Where is this coming from? You love adventures. You&#x2019;ve gone ice climbing with Jubal and me a million times. You&#x2019;ve gone caving. Hiking in remote, third world countries.&#x201d;</p><p>Gabrielle nodded. &#x201c;I went caving because you and Jubal did, and I enjoy spending time with you, but I don&#x2019;t live for adventures the way you do. I&#x2019;m really a homebody.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you crazy, Gabby? You&#x2019;re a genius who thrives on studying hot viruses. Newsflash, sister. Playing with that kind of virus without a way to fight it can get you killed. If you didn&#x2019;t like adventure you would never, under any circumstances, study them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You fight the world&#x2019;s injustices your way, and I fight them mine. Viruses make sense to me. I can solve the puzzle and try to help with things like finding a way to stop the Ebola virus from being let loose on the world. Vampires make no sense. None.&#x201d; She gave a little shudder. Joie would never understand that she escaped into a lab, that once she focused on whatever she was studying, everything around her disappeared and she didn&#x2019;t have to think about anything else at all.</p><p>&#x201c;You have crazy, mad skills in a lab, Gabby,&#x201d; Joie said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a genius, it isn&#x2019;t just Gary. He isn&#x2019;t smarter than you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Actually he is. Most men bore me silly after two minutes alone in their company. I can talk to Gary for hours. More, I can just listen to him when he talks to others. He&#x2019;s brilliant. He&#x2019;s also the kindest, sweetest man I know.&#x201d;</p><p>Joie shook her head. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a Daratrazanoff. Every bit of power, of knowledge, their blood, their ancestors, all of it was given to him in the cave of warriors. You know that. You were there. He was powerful before, Gabby. He&#x2019;s even more so now.&#x201d;</p><p>Gary always took the back of the hunters and he&#x2019;d never let any of them down during a battle, not once. Gabrielle knew it because when he&#x2019;d nearly died, their best hunters came in to give blood and to pay their respects. She knew it because Gregori Daratrazanoff had made him his brother, his own flesh and blood. The power of the Daratrazanoff family ran in his veins. Was in his heart and soul. Was there, in his mind.</p><p>Okay, she had to admit to herself she shied a little away from the sheer power there at times, but still, he was always her Gary. Gentle and kind with her. Seeing her when others couldn&#x2019;t&#x2014;or wouldn&#x2019;t. She&#x2019;d tried to tell Joie and Jubal that she was different, not at all wild or willful, but they laughed and said she didn&#x2019;t know herself very well.</p><p>Maybe she didn&#x2019;t. But she knew what she wanted&#x2014;what she&#x2019;d always wanted&#x2014;and that was Gary. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care what his last name is, or whose blood runs in his veins, he&#x2019;s <i>mine</i>,&#x201d; she declared firmly. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s always been mine, and I want him back. His life shouldn&#x2019;t be fighting vampires. He&#x2019;s such a genius and I miss him in the laboratory. I want him back there. Once we&#x2019;re married and we find a home, we can set up a lab and he can research for solutions to all the Carpathians&#x2019; problems <i>away</i> from the Carpathian Mountains and vampires and anything else that is monstrous.&#x201d;</p><p>Joie cleared her throat, and Gabrielle&#x2019;s gaze jumped to her younger sister.</p><p>&#x201c;Just tell me, Joie,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve always talked straight with each other.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t change him, Gabby. Gary is a man who will put himself in harm&#x2019;s way over and over if it comes to his sense of right or wrong. He has a clear sense of honor, of duty, and that&#x2019;s why Gregori accepted him from the start&#x2014;from the very beginning when he first met Gary. Gregori didn&#x2019;t associate with humans, but Gary already had the same values. He was willing to put himself on the line. Like Gregori, he&#x2019;s a man of action, and he&#x2019;s decisive about it.&#x201d;</p><p>Gabrielle shook her head. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve forced him to become like them. He belongs in a laboratory. He loves research and he&#x2019;s got the mind for it, Joie. You know he does, but more and more they&#x2019;re pulling him off that work to go hunt the vampire with them. He&#x2019;s with the prince and Gregori all the time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because they value his advice, Gabby,&#x201d; Joie said gently. &#x201c;You should be proud of him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am, superproud,&#x201d; Gabrielle assured her sister, and she <i>was</i> proud of Gary. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a brain. <i>Gregori</i> changed him.&#x201d;</p><p>Joie bit down on her lip, her eyes shadowed. &#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t, Gabby. Gregori wouldn&#x2019;t have changed him&#x2014;he couldn&#x2019;t. Fundamentally, Gary is the same man he always was. Gregori looked into his mind and he saw a brother&#x2014;a man who thinks as he thinks. Gregori accepted Gary because Gary is exactly like he is. Of course Gary didn&#x2019;t have the skills or knowledge to fight the undead, but he does now. He is Carpathian through and through. You have to be very sure you know him and you accept who he is, not just a small part of him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They almost got him killed. In a way they <i>did</i> get him killed.&#x201d; She ducked her head and twisted her fingers together. &#x201c;I was there when he was dying. I was <i>right</i> there. Do you know what he said when Gregori told him he was going to convert him? Gregori explained that Gary was <i>dying</i>. We all knew.&#x201d;</p><p>She pressed a trembling hand to her mouth as the memories flooded in, the ones she tried so hard to keep at bay. She actually felt sick to her stomach. Her lungs refused air and her heart accelerated to the point where she was afraid she might have a heart attack. She would never forget the sight of Gary, torn and bloody in so many places. He&#x2019;d saved the life of Zev Hunter, lifemate to Branislava of the Dragonseekers. Zev was <i>H�n ku pes�k&nbsp;kaikak</i>&#x2014;guardian of all and a very needed member of their people. But in saving Zev&#x2019;s life, Gary nearly died. So close. It had been a terrible few hours. The worst. She never wanted to go through that again.</p><p>She wasn&#x2019;t a healer like some of the women. That wasn&#x2019;t her gift. She didn&#x2019;t even know what her gift was other than a party trick or two. So she could look at a map and locate things. What good was that? Her family&#x2014;and the Carpathians&#x2014;said she was psychic, but she wasn&#x2019;t. Not like Joie, not like Jubal. She was just plain Gabrielle. No one special. But Gary was a gift, and he saw her that way as well. She&#x2019;d nearly lost him to the madness of Carpathian life.</p><p>&#x201c;He said he could better serve the people as human,&#x201d; she whispered, her fingers covering her mouth as if she couldn&#x2019;t say the words aloud. &#x201c;He was ready to die for them. He didn&#x2019;t make the decision to become Carpathian. Gregori made it for him.&#x201d;</p><p>There was hurt in her voice. She knew Joie heard it. The Carpathian people had been put above her. Everything in her life had changed when she&#x2019;d been nearly killed. A member of a human society of vampire killers had stabbed her repeatedly, a vicious, brutal attack. She still had nightmares, although she didn&#x2019;t share that with anyone, not even Gary. She had been brought into the Carpathian world in order to save her life.</p><p>Had it not been for Gary, she would have wished they hadn&#x2019;t saved her. She didn&#x2019;t belong. It was that simple. Mikhail, the prince of the Carpathian people, had given her the choice. Live or die. Of course, it had been her own decision to be converted, but Gary was a huge part of that. She&#x2019;d never had regrets because of him. At the time, terrified and in pain, she had been happy for the chance. Mostly, because she knew <i>this </i>day would come. Her day. The day she married Gary.</p><p>&#x201c;Gabby,&#x201d; Joie said. Her tone said it all. Compassionate. Sympathetic.</p><p>Gabrielle blinked back tears. &#x201c;I know he has a sense of duty. I know that. I love that about him. When we&#x2019;re bound together as lifemates, my soul to his, that sense of absolute duty and honor and love will be for me. I&#x2019;ll be first. Traian puts you first. Even Gregori puts Savannah first. Lifemates are always first.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re absolutely certain that Gary is the one for you, Gabrielle?&#x201d; Joie asked.</p><p>Gabrielle had always chosen to think before she spoke, especially to her sister and brother. She loved them both fiercely. She turned what Joie said over and over in her mind. Was she fooling herself? Was her love for Gary real? Did she see him the way he saw her? Because she knew, without a doubt, Gary saw her. Inside of her. He knew her better than anyone else had ever known her.</p><p>She moistened her lips. She had never really used her abilities as a Carpathian to look into Gary&#x2019;s mind. That was true. She could. He would have allowed it, but she wanted that human aspect of finding out slowly about her partner. She even needed it. ...</p></p><h2>Anne Morrow Lindbergh: Her Life</h2><p>An illuminating portrait of Anne Morrow Lindbergh--loyal wife, devoted mother, pioneering aviator, and critically acclaimed author of the bestselling <b>Gift from the Sea</b>.<br><br>Anne Morrow Lindbergh has been one of the most admired women and most popular writers of our time. Her <b>Gift from the Sea</b> is a perennial favorite. But the woman behind the public person has remained largely unknown. Drawing on five years of exclusive interviews with Anne Morrow Lindbergh as well as countless diaries, letters, and other documents, Susan Hertog now gives us the woman whose triumphs, struggles and elegant perseverance riveted the public for much of the twentieth century.</p><p>Susan Hertog managed to obtain 10 separate interviews with her very private subject (though not access to Anne Morrow Lindbergh's unpublished papers), and her personal involvement shows in every line of this impassioned biography. Hertog's searching account of the Lindbergh marriage explores the complex union of two people who loved each other deeply yet were emotionally ill-suited. Charles "saw the rebel heart inside the timid girl" and liberated a confined daughter of privilege into a world of adventure, but "[the] price she paid for her Prince" was high, including painful loneliness during his frequent absences and, most agonizingly, the 1932 death of their baby son. Though he was killed by kidnappers, in the Lindberghs' view he was equally a victim of the relentless publicity surrounding them. As the couple withdrew to protect their other children, Anne experienced a sense of isolation, but she was also liberated to explore her inner life and to delineate it in her writing--which was always supported by Charles. Hertog, who read <i>Gift from the Sea</i> (1955) as a new mother without knowing anything about its author, enthusiastically assesses that bestseller and other books in which Anne asserted that "a woman must come of age by herself," reminding readers that Anne Morrow Lindbergh is not the wife of a famous aviator, but a source of inspiration in her own right. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>"[This biography] is confident, graceful and shrewd.

Farber's lucid, elegantly designed paintings glow with color and light, with just a touch of humor and another of awe. Lovely. (Poetry/Picture book. 4+) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Ages 5-8. Presented in picture-book format, these short poems are first-person expressions of visitors to the Nativity, representing the points of view of animals who followed the Christmas star, Mary, three queens who came late, and a mother who didn't follow the star but tended her own baby instead. Traditionalists will be surprised to find a sloth making its way to Bethlehem, but the sloth's poem is one of the more effective, beginning, "As everyone knows, / I begin to begin to travel / when the wind blows.�20/ From bough to bough to bough, / Single-handedly I move. / Easy if you know how." Mathers' illustrations, painted in a naive style and reproduced in full color, vary from mundane to effective to striking.

In the 1970 s, Brown traveled extensively throughout Africa, India, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Brown would take a large paper map, cut out the city center, folded it up and slip it into his pocket, thus preventing him from looking like a tourist in areas where discretion is the better part of travel. This was his tool for surviving.</p><p>After many years on the road, Brown settled back in New York and decided to start his own business, based on the adaptations he had made to maps in his travels. His goal was to give someone the ability to navigate easily in unfamiliar terrain.</p><p>He started with a new map format: the accordion fold. Such a simple idea, but at the time it was revolutionary. No more struggling to fold an awkward, oversized paper map. This new format would enable the user to blend in like a native, instead of stick out like a tourist. Brown then added lamination to ensure that the map would be a lasting tool.</p><p>More important than the format was the design of the map itself. It had to be a map that not only succeeded above and beyond any map he had used, but was esthetically appealing as well. The look of it had to be as striking as the functionality. Color was introduced in a way that was never seen before in a map - vivid purple for water, soothing gray for the background of street grids, gold to highlight elements of the map. Clarity, conciseness and convenience in a very stylish package.</p><p>Building the business was a 24 hour job. Brown sold the maps during the day, zipping around Manhattan making deliveries on his Harley Davidson. At night he packed the orders and did the design work. More titles were added, each title requiring months of research and design.</p><p>Today, STREETWISE� produces over 130 titles for major destinations, regions and countries throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Europe, the United Kingdom and Asia. We have grown from the back of a motorcycle to selling millions of maps around the world.</p><p>Yet each title is still painstakingly researched and updated. STREETWISE� is one of the only, if not THE only map company that conducts research by walking or driving an area to ensure accuracy. After all, what good is the map if what you hold in your hands doesn t match what you see on the street sign? This lengthy fact checking results in superior accuracy; in effect, we ve done the work, now you have the adventure.</p><p>In the end, it s not about the map, it s about getting out and finding your own authentic experience wherever you go. It s about being in a city or a region and discovering things that you never thought you would find. You can do this if you have confidence and you have confidence if you have a great map.

After reading this book, even life-long mob aficionados will have a new perspective on organized crime.Informative, authoritative, and eye-opening, this is the first full-length book devoted exclusively to uncovering the hidden history of how the Mafia came to dominate organized crime in New York City during the 1930s through 1950s. Based on exhaustive research of archives and secret files obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, author and attorney C. Alexander Hortis draws on the deepest collection of primary sources, many newly discovered, of any history of the modern mob.Shattering myths, Hortis reveals how Cosa Nostra actually obtained power at the inception. The author goes beyond conventional who-shot-who mob stories, providing answers to fresh questions such as: * Why did the Sicilian gangs come out on top of the criminal underworld? * Can economics explain how the Mafia families operated? * What was the Mafia&#39;s real role in the drug trade? * Why was Cosa Nostra involved in gay bars in New York since the 1930s? Drawing on an unprecedented array of primary sources, The Mob and the City is the most thorough and authentic history of the Mafia&#39;s rise to power in the early-to-mid twentieth century.</p><p><b>C. Alexander Hortis, JD</b>, is an attorney specializing in commercial litigation and constitutional law. He has published articles on the Mafia in <i>The Informer: The History of American Crime &amp; Law Enforcement</i> and in <i>New York Law School Law Review</i>.Introduction<br><br><i>The Godfather</i> vs. New York History<br><br>When the cell doors clanged shut on Giuseppe Morello, Ignazio Lupo, and dozens of their men in the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary in 1910, their gang <i>should</i> have just dissolved into the streets of New York City. The Morello Family was just another struggling band of rogues, its modest numbers cut in half by convictions for a reckless counterfeiting scheme that had drawn the ire of the United States Secret Service. The Sicilians were small fish in New York&#x2019;s underworld. The Irish mob enjoyed natural ties to the docks and police force; African-American gangsters held sway in black Harlem and San Juan Hill; and Jewish organized crime was far stronger throughout the city.<br><br>Then, improbably, the <i>mafiosi</i> reconstituted themselves and returned with a vengeance. By the late 1930s, they evolved into the Cosa Nostra (&#x201c;Our Thing&#x201d;), the top syndicate in Gotham. By the 1950s, the Mafia families had grown to include two thousand &#x201c;made men&#x201d; and thousands more criminal associates entrenched throughout the economy, neighborhoods, and nightlife of New York.<br><br>The remarkable story of how the modern Mafia actually took power on the streets of New York remains largely hidden. Mob books gloss over this formative era with superficial &#x201c;rise of &#x201d; chapters that rehash dubious anecdotes from secondhand sources about the purported machinations of the bosses. Telling the Cosa Nostra&#x2019;s early history, however, requires digging up primary sources in archives. Moreover, the narrow obsession with the bosses (the &#x201c;godfathers&#x201d;) neglects the soldiers (the &#x201c;button men&#x201d;) who ran the rackets on the streets.<br><br>Mob history has been blurred by eighty years of Mafia mythology as well. America&#x2019;s greatest filmmakers have created indelible images of the mob, from Howard Hawks&#x2019;s <i>Scarface</i> to Martin Scorsese&#x2019;s gangster epics to Francis Ford Coppola&#x2019;s <i>The Godfather</i> trilogy. They have been joined by &#x201c;prestige dramas&#x201d; such as <i>The Sopranos </i>and <i>Boardwalk Empire</i>. <i>Mafiosi</i> themselves have influenced the narrative. Al Capone in the 1920s, Joey Gallo in the 1970s, and John Gotti in the 1980s all manipulated the media. In his 1983 autobiography <i>A Man of Honor</i> (a bestseller that&#x2019;s still in print), Joseph Bonanno painted a romanticized portrait of himself as a benevolent &#x201c;Father&#x201d; who fought Americanized mobsters trying to pervert his noble &#x201c;Tradition.&#x201d;<br><br>This is the first full-length book devoted specifically to uncovering the hidden history of how the street soldiers of the modern Mafia captured New York City during the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. While discussing the Prohibition era of the 1920s, this book argues that the key formative decade for the Mafia was actually the 1930s. The book covers such hot topics as: Who actually founded the modern Mafia? Who shot Albert Anastasia at the Park Sheraton barbershop? And who exactly was present at the 1957 meeting of the Mafia in the town of Apalachin, New York? At the same time, the book goes beyond traditional mob topics as well. It not only documents who shot who, but explores <i>how</i> and <i>why</i> the Cosa Nostra emerged in Gotham.<br><br>This revisionist history cuts through thickets of Mafia mythology with a machete of primary sources. It draws on the deepest collection of primary sources&#x2014;many newly discovered&#x2014;of any history of the modern Mafia. The primary sources include, among others, trial transcripts, investigative hearings, mayoral papers, personal memoirs, labor union records, and surveillance reports of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. These are complimented by internal files of the Federal Bureau of Investigation from the National Archives or obtained via the Freedom of Information Act. All of the quoted conversations in these pages are real and taken directly from primary sources. I supply extensive endnotes that allow readers to see the evidence for each chapter. This is an authentic history.<br><br>Contrary to its image, the Mafia was <i>not </i>primarily the product of Sicilian intrigue among the godfathers. As we will see, mob bosses had limited control over these lucrative crime franchises. Rather, the Cosa Nostra was forged by the street soldiers as they adapted to the unique conditions of twentieth-century Gotham. They captured New York City by becoming part of it.&nbsp;<br><br>This approach places the Mafia squarely back into New York history. It shows how the infamous &#x201c;French Connection&#x201d; heroin case was merely an offshoot of Mafia narcotics trafficking dating back to the dawn of America&#x2019;s drug war. It describes how the Cosa Nostra rode labor unions and business cartels to power during the New Deal. It shows why the Stonewall riots of 1969 were the culmination of the mob-run system of gay bars that dated to the 1930s. By replacing gauzy myths with historical evidence, we can see this extraordinary crime syndicate in a whole new light.</p><h2>Homeopathy: In a Nutshell (In a Nutshell Series)</h2><p>Homeopathy emphasizes treating the entire individual rather than just the symptom.

Not in the day, you can&#x2019;t. Still, it kept the youngsters quiet, precariously balancing on the ship&#x2019;s rail while they looked for it. When travelling with children, always keep a little game in hand for those last troublesome moments at the end of a long journey. <p></p><p></p>We adults stood close by, wrapped up in cloaks against the breeze and ready to dive in if little Julia and Favonia accidentally plunged overboard. To add to our anxiety, we could see all the crew making urgent attempts to work out where we were as we approached the long, low, famously featureless coastline of Egypt, with its numerous shoals, currents, rocky outcrops, suddenly shifting winds and difficult lack of landmarks. We were passengers on a large cargo boat that was making its first lumbering trip south this season; indications were that over the winter everyone had forgotten how to do this journey. The dour captain was frantically taking soundings and looking for silt in seawater samples to tell him he was near the Nile. Since the Nile delta was absolutely enormous, I hoped he was not such a poor navigator he had missed it. Our sailing from Rhodes had not filled me with faith. I thought I could hear that salty old sea god Poseidon laughing. <p></p><p></p>Some Greek geographer&#x2019;s turgid memoirs had supplied oodles of misinformation to Helena Justina. My sceptical wife and tour-planner reckoned that even from this far out you could not only see the Lighthouse, shining like a big confusing star, but also smell the city wafting across the water. She swore she could. True or not, we two romantics convinced ourselves that exotic scents of lotus oil, rose petals, nard, Arabian balsam, bdellium and frankincense were greeting us over the warm ocean&#x2014;along with the other memorable odours of Alexandria, sweaty robes and overflowing sewage. Not to mention the occasional dead cow floating down the Nile. <p></p><p></p>As a Roman, my handsome nose detected this perfume&#x2019;s darkest under-notes. I knew my heritage. I came fully equipped with the old prejudice that anything to do with Egypt involved corruption and deceit. <p></p><p></p>I was right too. <p></p><p></p>At last we sailed safely through the treacherous shoals to what could only be the legendary city of Alexandria. The captain seemed relieved to have found it&#x2014;and perhaps surprised at his skilful steering. We pootled in under the enormous Lighthouse then he tried to find one empty space to moor amongst the thousands of vessels that lined the embankments of the Eastern Harbour. We had a pilot, but pointing out a spare stretch of quay was beneath him. He put himself off into a bumboat and left us to it. For a couple of hours our ship manoeuvred slowly up and down. At last we squeezed in, shaving the paint on two other vessels with the joggle-mooring method. <p></p><p></p>Helena and I like to think we are good travellers, but we are human. We were tired and tense. It had taken six days from Athens, via Rhodes, and an interminable time out from Rome before that. We had lodgings; we were to stay with my Uncle Fulvius and his live-in boyfriend&#x2014;but we did not know them well and were anxious about how we would find their house. In addition, Helena and I were well-read. We knew our history. So, as we faced up to disembarkation, I could not help joking about Pompey the Great: how he was collected from his trireme to go ashore to meet the King of Egypt&#x2014;and how he was stabbed in the back by a Roman soldier he knew, butchered with his wife and children watching, then beheaded. <p></p><p></p>My job involves weighing up risks, then taking them anyway. Despite Pompey, I was all set to lead the way bravely down the gangplank when Helena shoved me out of her way. <p></p><p></p>&#x2018;Oh don&#x2019;t be ridiculous, Falco. Nobody here wants your head&#x2014; yet. I&#x2019;ll go first!&#x2019; she said. <p></p><p></p>Excerpted from Alexandria by Lindsey Davis.Copyright � 2009 by Lindsey Davis.<br>Published by St. Martin&#x2019;s Press. <p></p><p></p>All rights reserved.

She ran through three fortunes, four husbands, and countless lovers. She outflew Amelia Earhart, outsmarted Howard Hughes, outdrank the Mexican Army, and out- maneuvered the U.S. government. In <b>The Happy Bottom Riding Club</b>, award-winning author Lauren Kessler tells the story of a high-spirited, headstrong woman who was proud of her successes, unabashed by her failures, and the architect of her own legend.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Florence "Pancho" Barnes was a California heiress who inherited a love of flying from her grandfather, a pioneer balloonist in the Civil War. Faced with a future of domesticity and upper-crust pretensions, she ran away from her responsibilities as wife and mother to create her own life. She cruised South America. She trekked through Mexico astride a burro. She hitchhiked halfway across the United States. Then, in the late 1920s, she took to the skies, one of a handful of female pilots.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>She was a barnstormer, a racer, a cross-country flier, and a Hollywood stunt pilot. She was, for a time, "the fastest woman on earth," flying the fastest civilian airplane in the world. She was an intimate of movie stars, a script doctor for the great director Erich von Stroheim, and, later in life, a drinking buddy of the supersonic jet jockey Chuck Yeager. She ran a wild and wildly successful desert watering hole known as the Happy Bottom Riding Club, the raucous bar and grill depicted in The Right Stuff.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>In <b>The Happy Bottom Riding Club</b>, Lauren Kessler presents a portrait, both authoritative and affectionate, of a woman who didn't play by women's rules, a woman of large appetites--emotional, financial, and sexual--who called herself "the greatest conversation piece that ever existed."</p><p>A more unlikely minister's wife could hardly be imagined. Yet Florence Lowe Barnes (1901-74) was in fact married to an Episcopalian rector when she began training horses and flying stunt planes for Hollywood studios. As it turned out, however, the hard-drinking, hard-living, primarily male camaraderie she found there suited her far better than the well-mannered lifestyle of her affluent parents and undersexed husband. She acquired her nickname during a roistering 1927 trip to Mexico, and "Pancho" Barnes became legendary as a pioneering female pilot and a world-class party thrower with lovers to spare. (She was no beauty, but many men found Pancho's gusto and humor irresistible.) In the mid-'30s, past her prime as a pilot and looking for a business to support her free-spending ways, she set up as a Mojave Desert rancher near a tiny encampment of the Army Air Corps. Military and test pilots like Chuck Yeager flocked to Pancho's place--whether it was called Rancho Oro Verde, Pancho's Fly-Inn, or the Happy Bottom Riding Club--to savor her openhanded hospitality with food and booze, and to enjoy earthy stories about her past. Readers intrigued by Tom Wolfe's thumbnail sketch of Pancho in <i>The Right Stuff</i> will relish Lauren Kessler's full-length narrative of her adventurous life. <i>--Wendy Smith</i><br><b>Advance praise for The Happy Bottom Riding Club</b><br>"The hard-drinking, sexually promiscuous pilot and adventuress Florence 'Pancho' Barnes exploded every feminine stereotype on the books. Thank you, Lauren Kessler, for telling her story with the grace and exuberance it deserves."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---Barbara Ehrenreich<br>"Pancho Barnes is an unsung American eccentric who helped keep the 'wild' in Wild West. With tremendous zest, insight, and intelligence, Lauren Kessler has given us a compelling tale of a great woman who wasn't afraid to make life synonymous with risk."<br>---Karen Karbo, author of <i>Motherhood Made a Man Out of Me</i><br></p><h2>Slinky Malinki Open the Door (Hairy Maclary and Friends)</h2><p>When Slinky Malinki and Stickybeak Sid are left in the house on their own, they cause absolute mayhem by opening all the carefully shut doors in the house - and leave a trail of destruction from bathroom to bedroom to kitchen.

Brooklyn's 585-acre Prospect Park offers a rural refuge to thousands of visitors every day. Created nearly 150 years ago by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert B. Vaux, designers of New York's Central Park, the duo considered Prospect Park their true masterpiece. <em>Prospect Park</em>, the first monograph on this exquisite public space, makes it easy to see why. Presenting a wealth of archival and newly commissioned photography and insightful text, David P. Colley and Elizabeth Keegin Colley trace the park's colorful history from its creation in the mid-nineteenth century to its decline in the 1970s and restoration in the 1980s, up to the park's new Lakeside Center facility, scheduled to open in 2013.</p><p>David P. Colley is the author of seven books, including <em>Blood For Dignity</em> (named to the <em>New York Times</em> summer reading list and its New &amp; Noteworthy column) and <em>The Road To Victory</em>, which received the Army Historical Foundation's Distinguished Writing Award. Colley has appeared on various History Channel programs. His writing has appeared in the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>American Heritage</em>, <em>Popular Mechanics</em>, <em>Historic Preservation</em>, and many other publications. A former journalist, Colley is the recipient of numerous awards for excellence in news reporting.<br><br>Elizabeth Keegin Colley is a photographer specializing in work for non profit organizations including universities, park systems and libraries. Her work has appeared in the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>New York</em> magazine, <em>Newsweek</em>, <em>Business Week</em> and many other publications, and has taken her to Europe, South America and Africa."A big, lusciously photographed volume that's destined to become the Brooklyn house gift of the year." -- New York magazine<br><br>"This ode to a New York treasure explores the park's origins and continuing restoration... As Adrian Benepe, the former city parks commissioner, writes in his introduction, this 'rambunctious, bulging diamond' is Brooklyn's heart and magnet. In many respects, it is more impressive than Central Park, its older sibling." -- New York Times<br><br>"The most beautiful photographs of Prospect Park you've ever seen." -- Brooklyn magazine<br><br>"Prospect Park is one of New York City's most cherished green spaces. Its recent revitalization led by the Prospect Park Alliance is a terrific example of what can be achieved when the public and private sectors work together. Through its stewardship, the Prospect Park Alliance has provided a national model of park development and restoration, and its efforts will help ensure that Prospect Park will remain a New York City treasure for generations to come." -- Michael Bloomberg, New York City Mayor<br><br>"Prospect Park is New York City's urban emerald, a beautiful oasis in Brooklyn's heart and the embodiment of Brooklyn's soul. When Olmsted and Vaux designed Prospect Park, they achieved perfection, creating a true masterpiece that would enrich the city of Brooklyn and serve as a sanctuary and great equalizer for the many diverse communities of New York. When David and Elizabeth Colley put together this book about Prospect Park, they captured that perfection, illustrating the unique history and enduring appeal of one of our city's greatest treasures." -- Marty Markovitz, Brooklyn Borough President<br><br>"In many ways, Prospect Park is Brooklyn, a melting pot of immigrants and longtime residents, athletes and readers, artists and bankers. It is a place for our quietest reflections or our happiest celebrations. And like Brooklyn, the whole of Prospect Park is even greater than the sum of these wonderful parts." -- Spike Lee, Film Director<br><br>"Beautiful photographs capture every season, and accompanying text describes the artwork that went into creating what Sen. Charles Schumer calls 'Brooklyn's backyard.'" - Metro US</p><h2>Never Alone: A Personal Way to God</h2><p>The author of Joshua, Joshua and the Children, and The Shepherd unveils his personal way to God, describing a God who is neither silent nor condemning with words of wisdom, sympathy, and generosity. 100,000 first printing.

They are the desperate, the haunted, those who have reached the end of their ropes and are trying to make sense of a world that has failed them. The prostitutes and pimps, the addicts and the skinheads, who are the subjects of Vollmann's stories are all engaged in larger journeys of self-discovery. The hope that the next fix, the next night of sex, the next trip abroad will finally lead them to an always allusive internal peace. <p>"As diverse and exciting a group of stories as anyone has had to show for the last few years"--The Philadelphia Inquirer </p><p>"And certainly no one writing today of any generation has more news to relate than Vollmann, a rough-edged beast who has been slouching toward some millennial Bethlehem with a monstrous elegance, utter fearlessness, and voracious appetite that one associates with Melville, Whitman and Pynchon."--Los Angeles Times Book Review </p><p>"William T. Vollmann has become the reigning kid genius of American fiction."--USA Today </p><p>"William T. Vollmann looks to be the most prodigiously talented and historically important novelist under 35.... Since 1987 he has published books which tower over the work of his contemporaries by virtue of their enormous range, huge ambition, stylistic daring, wide learning, audacious innovation, and sardonic wit."--The Washington Post Book World </p><p>"William Vollmann is certainly the most unconventional--and possibly also the most exciting and imaginative--novelist at work today."--New York Newsday </p><p>William T. Vollmann is the author of Whores for Gloria, You Bright and Risen Angels, The Rainbow Stories, The Ice-Shirt, An Afghanistan Picture Show, Fathers and Crows, Butterfly Stories, The Rifles, and Open All Night (with photographs by Ken Miller). His collection of essays, The Atlas, was awarded the Pen Center West Award. He has also received the Whiting Foundation Award and the Shiva Naipaul Memorial Award for his fiction, and in June 1999 The New Yorker named him one of the twenty best American writers under the age of forty. His most recently published work is the novel The Royal Family.</p>Boisterous as ever, Vollmann continues to revel in quixotic moments of human experience similar to those in his other tales (Fathers and Crows, etc.), yet this collection is far less successful in providing a solid basis from which his anarchic vision can flourish. With San Francisco as a point of departure and the crisis of parting from it as a catalyst for reflection, Vollmann's narrator ponders a m&#x201a;lange of colorful but troubled acquaintances, tracing their individual journeys to dissolution and despair, as well as his own tortured experience. Tragic figures all, some of them manage at least to eke out a marginal existence, while others, like Elaine Suicide, are dead from the outset; the somber saga of her affair with handcuff-haunted Abraham in all its sadomasochistic splendor is the centerpiece here. From a father obsessed with dogtags stripped from a German soldier he'd killed in the closing moments of WW II, Abraham inherits a fetishism that becomes fully formed in his relationship with Elaine, as the two feed each other's fantasies in Gun City, U.S.A. Voyeurs and sorry dreamers of all kinds occupy other pieces--from hapless Ken, whose passion for Asian women prompts a string of disappointing liaisons, to failed operative Nicholas, whose enthusiasm for covert life in Latin America makes him unable to abandon it after his removal from US government service. Stitched between these tales are short, savage epitaphs for a range of dead heroes and objects, including a fierce jaguar hunted down in the jungle of Belize and, finally, the book itself. Energetic and witty if unfocused--but, still, this shows the prodigious talent that has been better realized in earlier work. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It was old and battered, its jaw missing, the eye sockets fixed in an eternal stare. The man who held it brushed dirt from the cheeks and brow and held it in one hand, considering the lines and planes of the old bones. The eyes of the skull and the eyes of the man met and for a long minute they shared the secrets of eternity, the subtle truths of the grave.</p><p>&#x201c;Alas,&#x201c; murmured the man in a voice that could hide no trace of the real hurt that wrenched his heart. &#x201c;Poor Yorick.&#x201d; He half turned to his companion. &#x201c;I knew him, Horatio.&#x201d;</p><p>In the shadows beyond a row of candles, thousands of invisible hands began applauding. Lawrence Talbot did not flick so much as a covert glance at the audience. His eyes remained locked with those of the skull, though his features shifted with a half dozen emotions as he turned the skull this way and that. When he regarded the brow his own brow knotted as if remembering old conversations; when turning it away from him his mouth betrayed the sadness of a boy suffering the disappointment of a beloved tutor; when he tilted the head back he smiled in remembrance of countless old jests. He shared the moment with the skull while the applause ran its course, and when it abated he spoke softly.</p><p>&#x201c;... a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He hath borne me on his back a thousand times. And now how abhorred in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft. Where be your gibes now, your gambols, your songs, your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table on a roar? No one now to mock your own grinning. Quite chap-fallen?&#x201d;</p><p>Lawrence did not shout or bleat. He spoke with tenderness to the skull and everyone in the theater bent forward to be included in the private discourse, hanging on his words, their senses entirely given over to the soft voice of the Prince of Denmark, for&#x2014; to the watching crowd&#x2014; this was not Lawrence Talbot, the American actor, this was Hamlet himself. Alive, real, his mocking words clear evidence of the tortured pain within his troubled soul.</p><p>Except for one man, a well-dressed buffoon to whom Shakespeare was a bore and Shakespeare performed, a torment. Before Hamlet and Horatio had wandered into the cemetery the man had nodded and drifted off to sleep and now his buzzing snore sought to undercut the moment.</p><p>But Lawrence was too practiced a professional to allow a fool to upstage him. He tossed the skull into the man&#x2019;s lap and continued with his soliloquy as if the act had been staged to include this moment. The skull landed hard on sensitive softness and the man shot upright in his seat, flushing red as the crowd around him erupted into laughter.</p><p>&#x201c;Now get you to my lady&#x2019;s chamber and tell her,&#x201c; continued Lawrence as he drew his energy and all eyes back to center stage, &#x201c;let her paint an inch thick, to this favor she must come...&#x201d;</p><p>Lawrence wore a suit of dark velvet and a ruffled shirt open to midchest. His wavy hair was as black as the pit and it framed a face that was rough and thoughtful and angry and handsome. &#x201c;Brutally handsome&#x201d; was the phrase used by The Times theater reviewer. He knew that everyone packed into the theater had read that review, and more than half of them were there because of it. When he stepped close to the footlights he was able to see past them to the rows of faces, each as pale as the moon, tilted up toward him, eyes fixed on him. The naked adoration in the faces of the women stoked fires within him, but the similarity of the faces&#x2014; each as empty and vacuous and uncomprehending as the next&#x2014; made him feel cold, empty. Gutted.</p><p>His full lips curled into a sneer. But they saw it as a smile and the applause rolled over him in waves.</p><p>Excerpted from The Wolfman by Jonathan Maberry.<br>Copyright � 2010 by Jonathan Maberry.<br>Published in February 2010 by Tom Doherty Associates.<br>All rights reserved.

He helps to keep the light of hope burning inside all of us throughout our lives,&#x201d; the angel told me. &#x201c;Hope plays an enormous part in everyone&#x2019;s life. Hope makes the impossible possible.&#x201d;<br> <br>I was about twelve years old when an angel told me this.<br> <br>I have been seeing and talking with angels since I was a little baby. I see angels every day and I see them physically as I see someone sitting in front of me. Angels are my friends and companions and I talk with them all the time, sometimes using words and sometimes without words. I have no idea why I should be able to see angels and you don&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;m just an ordinary person.<br> <br>I had seen the Angel of Hope previously, but this day when I was twelve was the first time that I learned who this particular angel was and how he helps us.<br> <br>The Angel of Hope doesn&#x2019;t look like any other angel I have ever seen. He looks like a massive flame. Within this very bright flame, I am shown a faint human appearance, which is masculine, and a beautiful dazzling emerald green color, holding a torch&#x2014;like an Olympic flame. The brightness of the Angel of Hope looks different to any other angel; I think this is because it&#x2019;s a light within a light.<br> <br>The Angel of Hope is enormous, the height of a mature tree. When I see him, he always seems to be very far away from me. So he should then look small, but he&#x2019;s always massive. It&#x2019;s quite strange&#x2014;it&#x2019;s as if he&#x2019;s very far away but right in front of me at the same time, hard as that is to explain.<br> <br>He seems to be forever moving, turning back constantly to encourage whoever he is leading at the time with a gentle smile. His expression is one of love and encouragement.<br> <br>Lately I have been seeing the Angel of Hope a lot more than I would have previously. I probably see him every day. People seem to be needing hope so much at this time.<br> <br>All those years ago, the angel showed me a vision of the Angel of Hope at work, so that I could understand more about him. I was shown the Angel of Hope guiding soldiers through a trench battlefield. I have no idea what nationality the soldiers were. I was shown one particular soldier crawling exhausted through the mud. I could see he was injured. The Angel of Hope was moving in front of him, constantly beckoning him forward. I was allowed to see through the soldier&#x2019;s eyes. The soldier could not see the Angel of Hope, but he saw a light, and within this light the soldier could see those he loved&#x2014;his wife and young children, his elderly parents. The Angel of Hope was giving him the strength to stay alive, encouraging him not to give up, by giving him hope of a reunion with the family he loved.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you understand, Lorna?&#x201d; the angel said. &#x201c;The Angel of Hope can&#x2019;t stop the war, heal this soldier, or rescue him, but he can give him the strength to make it to where he can be rescued.&#x201d; The angel smiled at me and continued. &#x201c;That soldier died in his bed many years later.&#x201d; I was so pleased with this news. The love that the young soldier had for his family was very beautiful.<br> <br>Whenever things have been difficult for me and my family I see the Angel of Hope there, trying to give me encouragement. This is in addition to my guardian angel and the other angels who will be around me helping.<br> <br>I remember one particular period&#x2014;being very stressed and worried about whether my husband, Joe, would get a job. He had been sick for a long time and off work but was now well enough to work. This was the 1980s in Ireland, though: things were tough, and jobs were hard to find. We had three children to feed, and I used to worry desperately. I kept on seeing the Angel of Hope, in the distance, turning toward me and smiling in encouragement. He kept the hope burning inside of me that Joe would eventually be successful in getting one of the jobs that he had applied for. It was quite a while before he did, and I was almost despairing&#x2014;but not quite. Seeing the Angel of Hope kept me going throughout this difficult period and helped me in giving encouragement and support to Joe. Joe was eventually successful in finding employment.<br> <br>The importance of hope should never be underestimated. With hope in our heart, we can do so much.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>I know a family whose second child was born with severe genetic difficulties. The doctors had told the parents that there was only a small chance their little girl would walk. The first time I saw this child, she was about nine months old. As her parents chatted to me with her in her father&#x2019;s arms, they were surrounded by angels who were very tall, a bright translucent, white and gave a female appearance. I could vaguely see wings. As with all angels, they were extremely beautiful. One of the angels told me, without words, that this family would not give up hope that this child would walk, no matter what the doctors said. As we talked, the father put the baby on the floor, and the angels around her encouraged her to move her legs and kick.<br> <br>The Angel of Hope appeared for one moment. His light was so bright, and it was as if everything disappeared except for the parents and the child. It was as if the parents could see the light of the Angel of Hope and could see his encouraging smile and were being filled with the light of hope. I know that every time they encountered a problem in relation to their daughter, the Angel of Hope would instill in them the courage to keep going.<br> <br>The Angel of Hope is one angel, but he is there to help everyone and can be in many places at once. In this he is like an archangel. He is there, briefly, whenever people need hope to lead them on and give them courage. Of course, other angels help to give us hope too.<br> <br>I see a guardian angel with everyone, regardless of their religion or nationality. I have never seen anyone, anywhere in the world, without a guardian angel. Your guardian angel is with you from before you are conceived until after your death and never leaves you even for one moment. It loves you unconditionally and will do everything possible to guide you through life and keep you filled with hope. Your guardian angel can let other angels in to help you too.<br> <br>A year or so later, I saw the child again. There were lots of adults there, and the child was being passed from one to another, the focus of everyone&#x2019;s love and attention. The child looked so bright to me, and the angels told me it was because of the level of encouragement the whole family was giving to the child. They were clearly all listening to their guardian angels and playing their part. At one stage, the father put the little one standing beside him. It was beautiful to see the angels encircling the child to try and keep her wobbly little legs strong, to stop them from giving under her. She is now three and she is walking. Not only is she walking, but they had brought her to the beach recently, and she had started to run&#x2014;if not very steadily.<br> <br>The parents and all of the family kept the light of hope burning for this child. They helped her to walk and are now hoping she will learn to talk properly too. This child is a beacon of hope, and the light of this hope has lit up the family, filling them and giving them hope in other areas of their lives. And it&#x2019;s not just the immediate family&#x2014;the wider family and neighbors have been inspired and filled with hope as a result of this example.<br><br>I see a lot of angels holding lights<br>in front of people, helping<br>to encourage them.<br><br>I see angels all of the time working hard to give us hope. I was sitting in a hotel reception recently, waiting for a journalist to arrive. The angels with me told me to get up and go and sit in the lounge. There was a man sitting at a low table by the window. On the table in front of him were some papers and a laptop. There were four angels sitting surrounding him. One of the angels was holding a bright light, about the size of a marble, in front of the man at chest height. When I see an angel holding a light in front of someone, I know that the person is having a tough time and that the angel is holding the light to help to give them hope and the courage to keep on going.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>One of the angels told me without words that the man was extremely worried and stressed over his business. I have no idea what his business was. The angels were encouraging him to see a solution, and they told me there was a solution somewhere within the papers, but he was too anxious to see it. One of the angels was trying to calm him down while one of the others kept reaching out and pointing to one particular sheet of paper. When he did this, the man would reach out to the sheet of paper but didn&#x2019;t seem to be seeing the solution. All of the time he was writing notes and crossing things out on his writing pad. At times, the light would get brighter for a moment and, without the angels telling me, I knew that was him seeing a glimpse of a solution, a glimpse of hope, a way out of his business difficulties. I sat there for about twenty minutes, as the journalist was late. I prayed for the businessman to find the solution. My heart went out to him. He looked so stressed and concerned. As I left, I asked the four angels around the table if he would see the solution before the day was out, and I was told that he mightn&#x2019;t see the whole solution but that he would at least have the idea, and over the next few days he would find a solution to the problem.<br> <br>These days I see a lot of angels holding lights in front of people, helping to encourage them. I see angels helping to kindle hope in us all the time&#x2014;hope at an individual, a community, a national, or a global level.<br> <br>Hope often starts with the little initiatives. One evening a few weeks ago, I came across a group of neighbors cleaning up a green near where I live. It&#x2019;s an area which has looked grubby and neglected for a long time. As they worked, they were surrounded by angels, who were whispering in their ears, encouraging them. As I walked past one, the angel said to me, &#x201c;Can you see the hope that is stirred up in these people?&#x201d; I smiled and the angel continued: &#x201c;Through small steps like this they can make their world a better place.&#x201d;<br> <br>The following day, I walked past the green again. I was amazed at how different it was. They had picked up the litter, cut the grass, and tidied up the flowerbed. The entire place felt so much brighter. One of the angels who was there called my attention to a little blackbird that was able to find a worm in the soil they had loosened. I had seen no birds there the day before.<br> <br>Hope brings a community together to make things better, and when it does, I see people get brighter, shine more, and then they can go on to achieve greater things. People who believe things can be changed for the better are beacons of light for us&#x2014;and need to be supported.<br> <br>Hope can be given to others. It gives strength and courage, and then hope grows. We all have a part to play in growing hope. In the past, people looked to leaders of churches, communities, businesses, countries to provide a vision of hope for the future, but now many of our leaders are struggling. They are failing to see the hope that is in front of them. They are failing to see all the ways in which we can make our world a better place to live.<br> <br>The angels have told me so much about hope and how much we have to be hopeful about, and have showed me so many different ways in which they help to give us hope.<br> <br>Everything I share with you in this book is from God and his angels. This book is a message of hope that has been given to me to share with each and every one of you, to help grow the light of hope within you.</p><h2>Outlines of Romantic Theology; With which is reprinted Religion and Love in Dante : The Theology of Romantic Love</h2><p>The book also includes Williams&#39; essay &#39;Religion and Love in Dante: The Theology of Romantic Love&#34;....... Alice M Hadfield on Charles Williams.&#39;s romantic theology: &#34;In experiencing romantic love, we experience God: He has been in the experience from the beginning, and the more we learn about it, the more we learn also about Him. . . .&#34; &#34;Romantic theology is . . . the working out of ways in which an ordinary relationship between two people can become one that is extraordinary, one that grants us glimpses, visions of perfection.&#34; &#34;For Williams, romantic theology was never just a subject for a book but a lifelong way of daily living.&#34; ..... Williams was admired by his contemporaries including T. S. Eliot, W. H. Auden, J.R.R. Tolkien and most especially by C. S. Lewis, whose novel &#39;That Hideous Strength&#39; is considered to be entirely inspired by Williams&#39;s work. When he moved to Oxford he participated regularly in Lewis&#39;s literary society known as the Inklings. This enabled Williams to read and improve his final published novel, All Hallows&#39; Eve, as well as to hear J. R. R.

Yes. Absolutely. We are in the midst of a massive global crisis of confidence. War and rumors of wars have made detente nigh unto impossible. Enmity and strife pervade every summit. Envy and suspicion cloud every treaty. Avarice and schism threaten every alliance. Most international theorists and foreign policy analysts can&#39;t offer much hope in the way of change. They simply don&#39;t have answers. But the Bible does. In this volume of the ground-breaking Biblical Blueprints Series, Dr. Gary North outlines specifically what those answers are. He shows how the obstacles to justice, peace, and harmony can be overcome if only we would act decisively and Scripturally. The Bible tell us what to do, when, where, how, and why. It offers us &#34;blueprints&#34; for global security. Healer of the Nations lays out those &#34;blueprints&#34; simply, practically, and understandably. It demonstrates that despite the pessimism of the experts there is still hope for our world.</p><p></p><h2>Deceived</h2><p>A sensuous story of lost love in Regency England, by a bestselling author and recipient of the Romantic Times Lifetime Achievement Award.

As a young officer, he constantly got in trouble for making too many arrests (too much paperwork, said the bosses), and as a transit detective he pioneered the fabled decoy squad that drove criminals out of the subways in the 1980s. Most important, Maple had ideas--ideas that would transform New York City, then other cities, and change the way people think about crime.<br><br>Maple knew from his twenty years on the force that stopping crime was not a priority of the police--unbelievable but true. Crooks worked nights and weekends, but the cops didn't want to. Vast areas of the city were written off by the police--because they thought they were lost forever. Too bad about the citizens who lived there.<br><br>Maple was determined to revolutionize the way crime is fought--how cops go after crooks, and how they prevent crime from happening in the first place. And he succeeded. Two years after Maple became Deputy Commissioner, the seemingly explosive crime rate was going down--fast: murder rate down 50 percent, crime down overall by 39 percent. And by 1998, the number of murders in New York City for the year was lower than in 1964. After his program was implemented in New Orleans, the violent crime rate in America's most dangerous city was cut in half between 1996 and 1999--and results were even better in Newark.<br><br>But Maple is not satisfied. In <b>The Crime Fighter</b> he tells the reader how crime can and should be attacked. Laced with fascinating, incredible and often humorous tales of Maple's adventures as a cop, the book is as entertaining as it is informative. Anyone interested in how criminals think and act, and how the police should do their jobs as servants of the people, not as an occupying force, will devour this absorbing book.</p><p>Jack Maple was a former NYPD transit cop who found himself appointed deputy commissioner in 1993. Upon assuming his new office, the erstwhile Don Quixote of urban crime led a charge to reform the way cops go about their everyday business--namely, busting the bad guys. Amazingly, Maple succeeded, and New York's crime rate--previously spiraling out of control--took a 39 percent tumble within two years of his ascension to policymaker, with murders alone falling an astounding 50 percent. <p> <i>The Crime Fighter</i> is the story of a regular beat cop with big ideas, and Maple's fast-paced, two-fisted tone helps punctuate an often madcap assortment of recollections. Maple's an unusual character to say the least, a somewhat rotund dandy who sports a bow tie and derby in public and nurtures a reputation as a gourmand. He takes the lion's share of credit for NYC's reduction in crime, but almost in an offhand, good-sportish way, rather than incessantly beating his own drum. He'd rather tell tales about the time he chewed out the chief ("I'll be damned if I'm going to start looking over my shoulder because of a guy down here wearing Ricky Nelson suits") or the time he played up his hemorrhoid problems to goad a prisoner into making a confession. Once he gets past his active days on the beat, Maple settles down into a steady rhythm, systematically laying out the obstacles he faced in trying to get his department to fight crime in an orderly, sensible manner, and then explaining the process whereby he went right ahead and did it. (The COMSTAT system he devised for storing and tracking crime information is now standard operating procedure in many police departments across the country.) <i>The Crime Fighter</i> never gets bogged down in its own grandeur--on the contrary, parts of Maple's look back read like good Elmore Leonard-type crime fiction, and several passages are so beautifully absurd that it takes a supreme effort of will to remember that, yes, a <i>cop</i> really wrote that. <i>--Tjames Madison</i></p>"Maple will leave you cheering as he scores victories over hack police brass, cheap politicians, and most importantly for the rest of us, himself. Book him."<br>-- Dennis Hamill, <i>New York Daily News</i> Columnist, Author of <b>Three Quarters</b> and <b>Throwing 7's</b><br><br>"Cops and crooks--nobody knows them better than Jack Maple; and nobody has ever told their story quite like the 'Jackster.'

Fairy-stories are not just for children, as anyone who has read Tolkien will know. In his essay On Fairy-Stories, Tolkien discusses the nature of fairy-tales and fantasy and rescues the genre from those who would relegate it to juvenilia. The haunting short story, Leaf by Niggle, recounts the story of the artist, Niggle, who has &#39;a long journey to make&#39; and is seen as an allegory of Tolkien&#39;s life. The poem Mythopoeia relates an argument between two unforgettable characters as they discuss the making of myths.

Schapiro's highly lucid arguments, graceful prose, and extraordinary erudition guide readers through a rich variety of fields and issues: the roles in society of the artist and art, of the critic and criticism; the relationships between patron and artist, psychoanalysis and art, and philosophy and art. Adapting critical methods from such wide-ranging fields as anthropology, linguistics, philosophy, biology, and other sciences, Schapiro appraises fundamental semantic terms such as "organic style," "pictorial style", "field and vehicle," and "form and content"; he elucidates eclipsed intent in a well-known text by Freud on Leonardo da Vinci, in another by Heidegger on Vincent van Gogh. He reflects on the critical methodology of Bernard Berenson, and on the social philosophy of art in the writings of both Diderot and the nineteenth century French artist/historian Eugene Fromentin. Throughout all of his writings, Meyer Schapiro provides us with a means of ordering our past that is reasoned and passionate, methodical and inventive. In so doing, he revitalizes our faith in the unsurpassed importance of both critical thinking and creative independence.</p><p>Meyer Schapiro (1904-1996) was a prolific art historian, critic, and teacher.

And at the feet of its wise Masters, Lanoree Brock learned the mysteries and methods of the Force&#x2014;and found her calling as one of its most powerful disciples. But as strongly as the Force flowed within Lanoree and her parents, it remained absent in her brother, who grew to despise and shun the Je&#x2019;daii, and whose training in its ancient ways ended in tragedy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now, from her solitary life as a Ranger keeping order across the galaxy, Lanoree has been summoned by the Je&#x2019;daii Council on a matter of utmost urgency. The leader of a fanatical cult, obsessed with traveling beyond the reaches of known space, is bent on opening a cosmic gateway using dreaded dark matter as the key&#x2014;risking a cataclysmic reaction that will consume the entire star system. But more shocking to Lanoree than even the prospect of total galactic annihilation, is the decision of her Je&#x2019;daii Masters to task her with the mission of preventing it. Until a staggering revelation makes clear why she was chosen: The brilliant, dangerous madman she must track down and stop at any cost is the brother whose death she has long grieved&#x2014;and whose life she must now fear.<br><br><b>Includes a special, full-color excerpt from the Dark Horse comic <i>Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi </i>and an original Dawn of the Jedi short story by John Ostrander!<br></b><br><b>Praise for <i>Into the Void</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;In a story filled with adventure, intrigue, and great quotes, there&#x2019;s a lot to like in this book.

And slowly, slowly, I am being eroded to nothing.<br><br>&#x2014;�Dalien Brock, diaries, 10,661 TYA<br><br>She is a little girl, the sky seems wide and endless, and Lanoree Brock breathes in the wonders of Tython as she runs to find her brother.<br><br>Dalien is down by the estuary again. He likes being alone, away from all the other children at Bodhi, the Je&#x2019;daii Temple of the Arts. Her parents have sent her to find him, and though they still have some teaching to do that afternoon, they&#x2019;ve promised that they will walk up to the boundary of the Edge Forest that evening. Lanoree loves it up there. And it scares her a little, as well. Close to the temple, near the sea, she can feel the Force ebbing and flowing through everything&#x2014;�the air she breathes, the sights she sees, and all that makes up the beautiful scenery. Up at the Edge Forest, there&#x2019;s a primal wildness to the Force that sets her blood pumping.<br><br>Her mother will smile and say that she will learn about it all, given time. Her father will look silently into the forest, as if he silently yearns to explore that way. And her little brother, only nine years old, will start to cry.<br><br>Always at the Edge Forest, he cries.<br><br>&#x201c;Dal!&#x201d; She swishes through the long grasses close to the riverbank, hands held out by her sides so that the grass caresses her palms. She won&#x2019;t tell him about the walk planned for that evening. If she does he&#x2019;ll get moody, and he might not agree to come home with her. He can be like that sometimes, and their father says it&#x2019;s the sign of someone finding his own way.<br><br>Dal doesn&#x2019;t seem to have heard her, and as she closes on him she slows from a run to a walk and thinks, If that was me I&#x2019;d have sensed me approaching ages ago.<br><br>Dal&#x2019;s head remains dipped. By his side he has created a perfect circle using the stones of chewed mepples, his favorite fruit. He does that when he&#x2019;s thinking.<br><br>The river flows by, fast and full from the recent rains. There&#x2019;s a power to it that is intimidating, and, closing her eyes, Lanoree feels the Force and senses the myriad life-�forms that call the river home. Some are as small as her finger, others that swim upriver from the ocean almost half the size of a Cloud Chaser ship. She knows from her studies that many of them have teeth.<br><br>She bites her lip, hesitant. Then she probes out with her mind and&#x2014;�<br><br>&#x201c;I told you to never do that to me!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dal . . .&#x201d;<br><br>He stands and turns around, and he looks furious. Just for a moment there&#x2019;s a fire in his eyes that she doesn&#x2019;t like. She has seen those flames before, and carries the knotted scar tissue in her lower lip to prove it. Then his anger slips and he smiles.<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry. You startled me, that&#x2019;s all.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re drawing?&#x201d; she asks, seeing the sketchbook.<br><br>Dal closes the book. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s rubbish.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe that,&#x201d; Lanoree says. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re really good. Temple Master Fenn himself says so.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Temple Master Fenn is a friend of Father&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br><br>Lanoree ignores the insinuation and walks closer to her brother. She can already see that he has chosen a fine place from which to draw the surroundings. The river curves here, and a smaller tributary joins from the hills of the Edge Forest, causing a confusion of currents. The undergrowth on the far bank is colorful and vibrant, and there&#x2019;s a huge old ak tree whose hollowed trunk is home to a flight of weave birds. Their spun golden threads glisten in the afternoon sun. The birdsong complements the river&#x2019;s roar.<br><br>&#x201c;Let me see,&#x201d; Lanoree says.<br><br>Dal does not look at her, but he opens the pad.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s beautiful,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;The Force has guided your fingers, Dal.&#x201d; But she&#x2019;s not sure.<br><br>Dal picks a heavy pencil from his pocket and strikes five thick lines through his drawing, left to right, tearing the paper and ruining it forever. His expression does not change, and neither does his breathing. It&#x2019;s almost as if there is no anger at all.<br><br>&#x201c;There,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s better.&#x201d;<br><br>For a moment the lines look like claw marks, and as Lanoree takes a breath and blinks&#x2014;�<br><br>A soft, insistent alarm pulled her up from sleep. Lanoree sighed and sat up, rubbing her eyes, massaging the dream away. Dear Dal. She dreamed of him often, but they were usually dreams of those later times when everything was turning bad. Not when they were still children for whom Tython was so full of potential.<br><br>Perhaps it was because she was on her way home.<br><br>She had not been back to Tython for more than four years. She was a Je&#x2019;daii Ranger, and so ranging is what she did. Some Rangers found reasons to return to Tython regularly. Family connections, continuous training, face-�to-�face debriefs, it all amounted to the same thing&#x2014;�they hated being away from home. She also believed that there were those Je&#x2019;daii who felt the need to immerse themselves in Tython&#x2019;s Force-�rich surroundings from time to time, as if uncertain that their affinity with the Force was strong enough.<br><br>Lanoree had no such doubts. She was comfortable with her strength and balance in the Force. The short periods she had spent with others on retreats on Ashla and Bogan&#x2014;�a voluntary part of a Padawan&#x2019;s training, should they desire to go&#x2014;�had made her even more confident in this.<br><br>She stood from her cot and stretched. She reached for the ceiling and grabbed the bars she&#x2019;d welded there herself, pulling up, breathing softly, then lifting her legs and stretching them out until she was horizontal to the floor. Her muscles quivered, and she breathed deeply as she felt the Force flowing through her, a vibrant, living thing. Mental exercise and meditation were fine, but sometimes she took the greatest pleasure in exerting herself physically. She believed that to be strong with the Force, one had to be strong in body.<br><br>The alarm was still ringing.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m awake,&#x201d; she said, easing herself slowly back to the floor, &#x201c;in case you hadn&#x2019;t noticed.&#x201d;<br><br>The alarm snapped off, and her Peacemaker ship&#x2019;s grubby yellow maintenance droid ambled into the small living quarters on padded metal feet. It was one of many adaptations she&#x2019;d made to the ship in her years out in the Tythan system. Most Peacemakers carried a very simple droid, but she&#x2019;d updated hers to a Holgorian IM-�220, capable of limited communication with a human master and other duties not necessarily exclusive to ship maintenance. She&#x2019;d further customized it with some heavy armor, doubling its weight but making it much more useful to her in risky scenarios. She spoke to it, its replies were obtuse, and she supposed it was the equivalent of trying to communicate with a grass kapir back home. She had even named it.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, Ironholgs. You better not have woken me early.&#x201d;<br><br>The droid beeped and scraped, and she wasn&#x2019;t sure whether it was getting cranky in its old age.<br><br>She looked around the small but comfortable living quarters. She had chosen a Peacemaker over a Hunter because of its size; even before she&#x2019;d flown her first mission as a Je&#x2019;daii Ranger, she knew that she would be eager to spend much of her time in space. A Hunter was fast and agile but too small to live in. The Peacemaker was a compromise on maneuverability, but she had spent long periods living alone on the ship. She preferred it that way.<br><br>And like most Rangers, she had made many modifications and adaptations to her ship that stamped her own identity upon it. She&#x2019;d stripped out the table and chairs and replaced them with a weights and tensions rack for working out. Now, she ate her food sitting on her narrow cot. She&#x2019;d replaced the holonet entertainment system with an older flatscreen, which doubled as communications center and reduced the ship&#x2019;s net weight. Beside the extensive engine compartment there had been a small room that housed a second cot for guests or companions, but because she had neither she had filled the space with extra laser charge pods, a water recycling unit, and food stores. The ship&#x2019;s four laser cannon turrets had also been upgraded, and it now also carried plasma missiles, and drone missiles for long-distance combat. At the hands of the Cathar master armorer Gan Corla, the cannons now packed three times more punch and were effective over twice the range as those standard to Peacemakers.<br><br>She had also altered and adapted the function and position of many cockpit controls, making it so that only she could effectively fly the ship. It was hers, it was home, and that was how she liked it.<br><br>&#x201c;How long to Tython?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>The droid let out a series of whines and clicks.<br><br>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; Lanoree said. &#x201c;Suppose I&#x2019;d better freshen up.&#x201d; She brushed a touch pad and the darkened screens in the forward cockpit faded to clear, revealing the star-�speckled view that never failed to make her heart ache. There was something so profoundly moving to the distance and scale of what she saw out there, and the Force never let her forget that she was a part of something incomprehensibly large. She supposed it was as close as she ever came to a religious epiphany.<br><br>She touched the pad again and a red glow appeared, surrounding a speck in the distance. Tython. Three hours and she&#x2019;d be there.<br><br>The Je&#x2019;daii Council ordering her back to Tython meant only one thing. They had a mission for her, and it was one that they needed to discuss face-�to-�face.<br><br>***<br><br>Washed, dressed, and fed, Lanoree sat in the ship&#x2019;s cockpit and watched Tython drawing closer. Her ship had communicated with sentry drones orbiting at thirty thousand kilometers, and now the Peacemaker was performing a graceful parabola that would take it down into the atmosphere just above the equator.<br><br>She was nervous about visiting Tython again, but part of her was excited as well. It would be good to see her mother and father, however briefly. She contacted them far too infrequently. With Dal dead, she was now their only child.<br><br>A soft chime announced an incoming transmission. She swiveled her seat and faced the flatscreen, just as it snowed into an image.<br><br>&#x201c;Master Dam-�Powl,&#x201d; Lanoree said, surprised. &#x201c;An honor.&#x201d; And it was. She had expected the welcoming transmission to be from a Je&#x2019;daii Ranger or perhaps even a Journeyer she did not know. Not the Cathar Je&#x2019;daii Master.<br><br>Dam-�Powl bowed her head. &#x201c;Lanoree, it&#x2019;s good to see you again. We&#x2019;ve been eagerly awaiting your arrival. Pressing matters beg discussion. Dark matters.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I assumed that was the case,&#x201d; Lanoree said. She shifted in her seat, unaccountably nervous.<br><br>&#x201c;I sense your discomfort,&#x201d; Master Dam-�Powl said.<br><br>&#x201c;Forgive me. It&#x2019;s been some time since I spoke with a Je&#x2019;daii Master.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You feel unsettled even with me?&#x201d; Dam-�Powl asked, smiling. But the smile quickly slipped. &#x201c;No matter. Prepare yourself, because today you speak with six Masters, including Stav Kesh&#x2019;s Temple Master Lha-�Mi. I&#x2019;ve sent your ship the landing coordinates for our meeting place thirty kilometers south of Akar Kesh. We&#x2019;ll expect you soon.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Master, we&#x2019;re not meeting at a temple?&#x201d;<br><br>But Dam-�Powl had already broken the transmission, and Lanoree was left staring at a blank screen. She could see her image reflected there, and she quickly gathered herself, breathing away the shock. Six Je&#x2019;daii Masters? And Lha-�Mi as well?<br><br>&#x201c;Then it is something big.&#x201d;<br><br>She checked the transmitted coordinates and switched the flight computer to manual, eager to make the final approach herself. She had always loved flying and the freedom it gave her. Untethered. Almost a free agent.<br><br>Lanoree closed her eyes briefly and breathed with the Force. It was strong this close to Tython, elemental, and it sparked her senses alive.</p><h2>I Wanted to Know All about God</h2><p><i>I wanted to know all about God,&nbsp;<br> So I went looking for him in signs of His creation . . .</i><br><br>In simple, poetic language this engaging book explores the kinds of questions children ask about God: What does God do in the morning?

We start with the Greeks, who celebrated sexuality at Dionysiac festivals and at temples to Aphrodite, and the Romans who imported unwholesome brutalities into their orgiastic celebrations.

He is currently working on the ABC line of comics, which also includes Tomorrow Stories, Promethea, Top Ten and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (all published by Titan). Chris Sprouse has worked on such diverse titles as HammerLocke, Glory, Legion of Super-Heroes, Starman, Legionnaires and WildC.A.T.s/Altens.Of the characters Moore created in his late 1990s return to mainstream comics, "science hero" Tom Strong best expressed the fun that Moore wanted to restore to the costumed-adventurer genre. Analogous to 1930s pulp hero Doc Savage, Strong was raised in a science experiment on a remote island. Having achieved physical and mental perfection and relocated to Millennium City, he fights assorted threats to civilization, assisted by wife Dahlua, headstrong daughter Tesla, robot manservant Pneuman, talking ape King Solomon, and the Strongmen of America, his youthful fan club. In this collection, three-eyed space cowboy Coleman Grey comes to warn Strong about an army of billions of giant, alien ants intent on enslaving Earth, which prompts a good old-fashioned intergalactic battle. <i>Tom Strong</i> could be a mere pastiche, but Moore's clever conceptualizing and deft characterization make it one of the most purely enjoyable comics on the stands today. The art, mostly by Chris Sprouse, has a crisp clarity that accentuates the title's traditionalism while seeming thoroughly modern.<p> <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Whether it sells computers, clothing, or cars, your firm's fate is increasingly linked to that of many other firms, all of which must collaborate effectively in order for each to thrive. This phenomenon has changed the basis of competition from battle between firms to battles between networks of firms--and more than ever before, success depends on managing assets your company doesn't own.</p><p>In <i>The Keystone Advantage</i>, Marco Iansiti and Roy Levien offer a new lens for understanding how these ubiquitous and complex business networks behave and explore the implications for strategy formulation, innovation, and operations management. Iansiti and Levien argue that biological ecosystems provide a powerful analogy to the functioning of business networks. Just as "keystone species" in nature play central roles in their ecosystems, companies such as Walmart, Microsoft, and Li &amp; Fung deploy "keystone strategies" to actively shape and regulate the workings of their business ecosystems--dramatically improving their own performance in the process. Iansiti and Levien argue that the best keystones simplify the challenge of connecting a very large and distributed network of companies to their customers and provide "platforms" that other firms can leverage to increase productivity, enhance stability, and spur innovation.</p><p>Drawing from more than ten years of research and practical experience across a range of industries, the authors identify three specific roles that firms play within business ecosystems: keystone, dominator, and niche. The book lays out a framework any firm can use to assess the characteristics of its own ecosystem, reevaluate its technology and operations strategy, and formulate specific tactics for gaining sustainable competitive advantage.</p><p>Practical and insightful, <i>The Keystone Advantage</i> will help leaders, managers, and policy makers to understand, analyze, and successful execute strategy in today&#x2019;s networked environments.</p></p><p><p><b>Marco Iansiti</b> is the David Sarnoff Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School and a cofounder of Keystone Strategy Inc., a consulting firm on strategy and innovation management. <b>Roy Levien</b> is a principal at Aldaron and founder of Keystone Advantage LLC.</p></p><h2>Hedgehogs in the Hall (Animal Ark Series #5)</h2><p>When Mandy rescues a hedgehog family in danger, she knows that the wild creatures cannot stay long at Animal Ark, but she does not think it is a good idea to send them back into the wild, either.

For centuries since, she has been the object of debate, speculation, and the fascination so often accorded illustrious figures in history. Married in mere girlhood, this essentially lighthearted child was thrust onto the royal stage and commanded by circumstance to play a significant role in European history. Antonia Fraser&#39;s lavish and engaging portrait excites compassion and regard for all aspects of the queen, immersing the reader not only in the coming-of-age of a graceful woman, but in the culture of an unparalleled time and place.</p><p>In the past, Antonia Fraser's bestselling histories and biographies have focused on people and events in her native England, from <i>Mary Queen of Scots</i> to <i>Faith and Treason: The Story of the Gunpowder Plot</i>. Now she crosses the Channel to limn the life of France's unhappiest queen, bringing along her gift for fluent storytelling, vivid characterization, and evocative historical background. Marie Antoinette (1755-93) emerges in Fraser's sympathetic portrait as a goodhearted girl woefully undereducated and poorly prepared for the dynastic political intrigues into which she was thrust at age 14, when her mother, Empress Maria Theresa, married her off to the future Louis XVI to further Austria's interests in France. Far from being the licentious monster later depicted by the radicals who sent her to the guillotine at the height of the French Revolution, young Marie Antoinette was quite prudish, as well as thoroughly humiliated by her husband's widely known failure to have complete intercourse with her for seven long years (the gory details were reported to any number of concerned royal parties, including her mother and brother). She compensated by spending lavishly on clothes and palaces, but Fraser points out that this hardly made her unique among 18th-century royalty, and in any case the causes of the Revolution went far beyond one woman's frivolities. The moving final chapters show Marie Antoinette gaining in dignity and courage as the Revolution stripped her of everything, subjected her to horrific brutalities (a mob paraded the head of her closest female friend on a pike below her window), and eventually took her life. Fraser makes no attempt to hide the queen's shortcomings, in particular her poor political skills, but focuses on her personal warmth and noble bearing during her final ordeal. It's another fine piece of popular historical biography to add to Fraser's already impressive bibliography. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>France&#39;s beleaguered queen, Marie Antoinette, wrongly accused of uttering the infamous &#34;Let them eat cake,&#34; was the subject of ridicule and curiosity even before her death; she has since been the object of debate and speculation and the fascination so often accorded tragic figures in history. Married in mere girlhood, this essentially lighthearted, privileged, but otherwise unremarkable child was thrust into an unparalleled time and place, and was commanded by circumstance to play a significant role in history. Antonia Fraser&#39;s lavish and engaging portrait of Marie Antoinette, one of the most recognizable women in European history, excites compassion and regard for all aspects of her subject, immersing the reader not only in the coming-of-age of a graceful woman, but also in the unraveling of an era.</p><h2>Zillions of Practice Problems: Pre-Algebra 1 with Biology</h2><p>Zillions of Practice Problems Pre-Algebra 1 with Biology has lots more to do with math, with biology, and with the continuing adventures of Jan and Ivy.

Going with him was Lieutenant George Douglas Brewerton, who describes their journey over the Old Spanish Trail. It was a torturous route across deserts and mountains requiring the kind of expert survival skills that made Kit Carson famous. The scout, who was carrying the news that would begin the rush for gold, went as far as Taos, where he was reunited with his wife. From there Brewerton joined a wagon train that labored over the Santa Fe Trail to Independence, Missouri. &nbsp;<i>Overland with Kit Carson</i> is a colorful and authentic account of encounters with Indians and white adventurers and of the hazards and hardships that accompanied anyone who undertook such a long journey in a sparsely populated country.</p><p>The new introduction is by Marc Simmons, a professional historian, editor, translator, and the author of <i>Witchcraft in the Southwest: Spanish and Indian Supernaturalism on the Rio Grande</i> (Bison Book, 1980)."Of prime importance to many general readers as well as to historians will be Brewerton&#x2019;s intimate and concrete pictures of Kit Carson."&#x2014;<i>Southwest Review</i> (<i>Southwest Review</i>)</p><h2>The World We Found: A Novel</h2><p>Thrity Umrigar, acclaimed author of <em>The Space Between Us </em>and <em>The Weight of Heaven</em>, returns with a breathtaking new novel&#x2014;a skillfully wrought, emotionally resonant story of four women and the indelible friendship they share.

Originally published in 1969, Pache&#39;s work has been appreciated by many as one of the best in the field. Pache is uncompromising, clear and very readable in this translation by Helen I. Needham.(from the Preface) One of the most significant of all themes to the Christian is that of the inspiration and authority of the Bible. The truths concerning God, Christ and salvation are surely of supreme importance. But how can we get to know these truths if it is not by means of the Scriptures themselves? In this sense, one might say that the inspiration of Scripture is the first dogma of all: If the Scriptures are truly of God, clothed with His authority and put entirely within the reach of man, all revealed religion has a solid foundation on which to stand. If, on the other hand, inspiration is uncertain, partial, or varying according to the experience and opinion of the reader or the preacher, everything totters.</p><h2>The Breadwinner: An Afghan Child in a War Torn Land</h2><p>Parvana felt the shadow before she saw it, as the man moved between her and the sun. Turning her head, she saw the dark turban that was the uniform of the Taliban. A rifle was slung across his chest as her father&#39;s shoulder bag had been slung across hers.... The Talib kept looking down at her. Then he put his hand inside his vest. Keeping his eyes on Parvana, he drew something out of his vest pocket. Parvana was about to squish her eyes shut and wait to be shot when she saw the Talib had taken out a letter. He sat down beside her on the blanket. &#34;Read this,&#34; he said. Imagine living in a country in which women and girls are not allowed to leave the house without a man. Imagine having to wear clothes that cover every part of your body, including your face, whenever you go out. This is life in Afganistan, where the Taliban, members of an extreme religious group, until recently ran most of the country.</p><p></p><h2>Socks - Socks - Socks: 70 Winning Patterns from Knitter&#39;s Magazine Contest</h2><p>Provides patterns for basic socks, as well as children&#39;s socks, Icelandic socks, lace socks, and socks featuring specific colors, textures, or whimsical themes</p><p>Several years ago, Knitter's Magazine announced a contest for knitted socks.

One of his country&#x2019;s most famous writers, he was forced into exile in 1933, returning from the United States to Switzerland in 1947, and to East Berlin in 1949. Some of his most famous plays are <i>The Threepenny Opera</i>, <i>Mother Courage</i>, <i>Life of Galileo</i> and <i>The Caucasian Chalk Circle</i>.&#x201c;An album of pity and anger which fixes the evil of war for all time.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;<i>Observer</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;A handsome edition of War Primer, a series of short poems illustrated and inspired by war photographs Brecht clipped from newspapers.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;David Edgar, <i>London Review of Books</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Tender, angry and incisive.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;<i>Independent</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;A modern equivalent of Goya.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;<i>Guardian</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Brecht reprinted photographs from wartime mass-circulation magazines, replacing the captions with short poems about the essential truth of each image.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;<i>Daily Telegraph</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Deserves a place of the shelves of every public and school library.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;<i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;By themselves the images are disturbing, often terrifying. The four lines of poetry make them devastating. They achieve this through what was Brecht&#x2019;s greatest strength as a writer: his ability to coax out the twisted, icy rationale of a world whose overriding logic is self-justification. The bitter chuckle brought on in the reader by these words reveals unsettling machinations. War, capital and fascism are made mundane before that very mundanity is turned inside out by dint of its own force.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;Alexander Billet, <i>Red Wedge</i></b></p><h2>Hypnagogia: The Unique State of Consciousness Between Wakefulness and Sleep</h2><p>Dealing with hypnagogia, the state of consciousness between wakefulness and sleep, this book provides an account of hypnagogia, bringing its diverse phenomena into a comprehensive framework. Andreas Mavromatis argues that this common, naturally occurring state may not only be distinct from wakefulness and sleep but unique in its nature and function, possibly carrying important evolutionary implications. He analyzes the relationship between hypnagogia and other states, processes and experiences - such as sleepdreams, meditation, psi, schizophrenia, creativity, hypnosis, hallucinogenic drug-induced states - and shows that, functioning in hypnagogia, a person may gain knowledge of aspects of his or her mental nature which constitute fundamental underpinnings to all adult thought. In addition, functioning in hypnagogia is shown to play a significant part in mental and physical health. This book should be of interest to general readers of psychology, mind, body and spirit.</p><p></p><h2>Life in the French Country House</h2><p>An account of upper class French society through the centuries showing how its setting - the &#34;chateaux&#34; and &#34;manoirs&#34; of the French countryside evolved in concert with their inhabitants.</p><p>"Splendid . . .

Now in Kellerman&#x2019;s gripping new novel, a different hero will hold the reader spellbound: a dedicated young psychologist, unschooled in the ways of violent crime and incalculable evil&#x2013;until his life is irreversibly touched by both . . . and he is thrust into a chilling hunt for a twenty-first-century Jack the Ripper.<br><br>When his brief, passionate romance with nurse Jocelyn Banks is cut short by her kidnapping and brutal murder, Dr. Jeremy Carrier is left emotionally devastated, haunted by his lover&#x2019;s grisly demise and warily eyed by police still seeking a prime suspect in the unsolved slaying. To escape the pain, he buries himself in his work as staff psychologist at City Central Hospital&#x2013;only to be drawn deeper into a waking nightmare when more women turn up murdered in the same gruesome fashion as Jocelyn Banks . . . and the suspicion surrounding Jeremy intensifies. Now, the only way to prove his innocence and put his torment to rest is to follow the trail of a cunning psychopath.<br><br>Spurring on Jeremy&#x2019;s investigation is Dr. Arthur Chess, an enigmatic pathologist who specializes in examining the dead, but harbors a keen fascination with the darker deeds committed by the living. Arthurdraws Jeremy into an unexpected friendship, and into the confidence of a cryptic society devoted to matters unknown and unspoken.

Before the killer strikes again, Jeremy races to connect the disturbing puzzle pieces being fed to him. Yet his search for answers only seems to yield more questions. And deepening the mystery is the undeniable presence of someone watching it all&#x2013;and guiding Jeremy&#x2019;s investigation from behind the scenes.

As a practitioner of the former, Jeremy prided himself on an open mind; a good psychotherapist worked hard at avoiding stereotypes.<br><br>But during all his years of training and clinical work at City Central Hospital, Jeremy had met few pathologists who didn&#x2019;t fit a mold: withdrawn, mumbly types, more comfortable with gobbets of necrosed flesh, the abstract expressionism of cell smears, and the cold-storage ambience of the basement morgue, than with living, breathing patients.<br><br>And his fellow psychologists, psychiatrists, and all the other soldiers of the mental health army, were, more often than not, overly delicate souls repelled by the sight of blood.<br><br>Not that Jeremy had actually known any pathologists, even after a decade of passing them in the hallways. The social structure of the hospital had regressed to high school sensibilities: Us-Them as religion, a lusty proliferation of castes, cliques, and cabals, endless jockeying for power and turf. Adding to that was the end-means inversion that captures every bureaucracy: the hospital had devolved from a healing place needing funds to treat patients to a large-scale municipal employer requiring patient fees to meet its staff payroll.<br><br>All that created a certain asocial flavor.<br><br>A confederacy of isolates.<br><br>At City Central, like was attracted to like, and only the last-ditch necessities of patient care led to cross-pollination: internists finally admitting defeat and calling in surgeons, gen- eralists taking deep breaths before plunging into the morass of consultation.<br><br>What reason could there be for a pathologist to contact a psychologist?<br><br>Because of all that&#x2014;and because life&#x2019;s hellish wrist-flick had turned Jeremy Carrier into a tormented, distracted young man&#x2014;he was caught off-balance by Arthur Chess&#x2019;s overture.<br><br>Perhaps Jeremy&#x2019;s distractibility formed the basis for all that followed.<br>For nearly a year, Jeremy had seen Arthur once a week, but the two men had never exchanged a word. Yet here was Arthur, settling down opposite Jeremy in the doctors&#x2019; dining room and asking if Jeremy cared for company.<br><br>It was just before 3 p.m., an off-hour for lunch, and the room was nearly empty.<br><br>Jeremy said, &#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; then realized he was anything but.<br><br>Arthur nodded and settled his big frame into a small chair. His tray bore two helpings of fried chicken, a hillock of mashed potatoes glazed with gravy, a perfect square of corn bread, a small bowl of succotash, and a sweating can of Coca-Cola.<br><br>Staring at the food, Jeremy wondered: Southern roots? He tried to recall if Arthur&#x2019;s voice had ever betrayed Southern inflections, didn&#x2019;t think so. If anything, the old man&#x2019;s baritone was flavored by New England.<br><br>Arthur Chess showed no immediate interest in conversation. Spreading a napkin on his lap, he began shearing through the first piece of chicken. He cut quickly and gracefully, using long fingers tipped by broad nails stubbed short. His long white lab coat was snowy-clean but for a disturbing spatter of pinkish stains on the right sleeve. The shirt beneath the coat was a blue pinpoint Oxford spread-collar. Arthur&#x2019;s magenta bow tie hung askew in a way that suggested intention.<br><br>Jeremy figured the pathologist for at least sixty-five, maybe older, but Arthur&#x2019;s pink skin glowed with health. A neat, white, mustachless beard, which gave insight into what Lincoln&#x2019;s would&#x2019;ve looked like had Honest Abe been allowed to grow old, fringed Arthur&#x2019;s long face. His bald head was lunar and imposing under cruel hospital lighting.<br><br>Jeremy knew of Arthur&#x2019;s reputation the way one is aware of a stranger&#x2019;s biography. Once Head of Pathology, Professor Chess had stepped down from administrative duties a few years ago to concentrate on scholarship. Something to do with soft-tissue sarcomas, the minutiae of cell-wall permeability, or whatnot.<br><br>Arthur also had a reputation as a world traveler and an amateur lepidopterist. His treatise on the carrion-eating butterflies of Australia had been featured in the hospital gift shop, alongside the usual paperback diversions. Jeremy had noticed the single stack of dry-looking, dirt brown volumes because they drabbed in comparison with the jackets of lurid best-sellers. The brown stack never seemed to reduce; why would a patient want to read about bugs that ate corpses?<br><br>Arthur ate three bites of chicken and put down his fork. &#x201c;I really do hope this isn&#x2019;t an intrusion, Dr. Carrier.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not at all, Dr. Chess. Is there something you need?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Need?&#x201d; Arthur was amused. &#x201c;No, just seeking a bit of social discourse. I&#x2019;ve noticed that you tend to dine alone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My schedule,&#x201d; lied Jeremy. &#x201c;Unpredictable.&#x201d; Since his life had gone to hell, he&#x2019;d been avoiding social discourse with anyone but patients. He&#x2019;d gotten to the point where he could fake friendly. But sometimes, on the darkest of days, any human contact was painful.<br><br>Life&#x2019;s little wrist-flick . . .<br><br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; said Chess. &#x201c;Given the nature of your work, that would have to be the case.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sir?&#x201d; said Jeremy.<br><br>&#x201c;The unpredictability of human emotions.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s true.&#x201d;<br><br>Arthur nodded gravely, as if the two of them had reached a momentous agreement. A moment later, he said, &#x201c;Jeremy&#x2014;may I call you Jeremy?&#x2014;Jeremy, I noticed you weren&#x2019;t at our little Tuesday get-together this week.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A situation came up,&#x201d; said Jeremy, feeling like a child caught playing hookey. He forced a smile. &#x201c;Unpredictable emotions.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Something that resolved well, I hope?&#x201d;<br><br>Jeremy nodded. &#x201c;Anything new come up at T.B.?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Two new diagnoses, an adenosarcoma, and a CML. Typical presentations, the usual spirited discussion. To be honest, you didn&#x2019;t miss a thing.&#x201d;<br><br>Our little Tuesday get-together was Tumor Board. A weekly ritual, 8 to 9 a.m., in the larger conference room, Arthur Chess presiding over a confab of oncologists, radiotherapists, surgeons, nurse specialists. Commanding the slide projector, wielding a light wand, and his voluminous memory.<br><br>For nearly a year, Jeremy had been the mental health army&#x2019;s representative. In all that time, he&#x2019;d spoken up once.<br><br>He&#x2019;d attended his first Tumor Board years before, as an intern, finding the experience an ironic grotesquerie: slides of tumor-ravaged cells click-clicked on a giant screen, the images obscured by nicotine haze.<br><br>At least a third of the cancer doctors and nurses were puffing away.<br><br>Jeremy&#x2019;s supervisor at the time, an astonishingly pompous psychoanalyst, had wielded a Meerschaum pipe of Freudian proportions and blown Latakia fumes in Jeremy&#x2019;s face.<br><br>Arthur had been running things back then, too, and he&#x2019;d looked much the same, Jeremy realized. The chief pathologist hadn&#x2019;t smoked, but neither had he objected. A few months later, a wealthy benefactor touring the hospital poked her head in and gasped. Soon after, the hospital passed a no-smoking rule, and the mood at subsequent Tumor Boards grew testy.<br><br>Arthur sectioned a tiny square of corn bread from the host slab and chewed thoughtfully. &#x201c;No loss for you, Jeremy, but I do believe that your presence contributes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Really.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Even if you don&#x2019;t say much, the fact that you&#x2019;re there keeps the rest of us on our toes. Sensitivity-wise.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; said Jeremy, wondering why the old man was bullshitting him so shamelessly, &#x201c;anything that helps sensitivity.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The time you did speak up,&#x201d; said Arthur, &#x201c;taught us all a lesson.&#x201d;<br><br>Jeremy felt his face go hot. &#x201c;I felt it was relevant.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, it was, Jeremy. Not everyone saw it that way, but it was.&#x201d;<br>The time he spoke up had been six weeks ago. Arthur flashing slides of a metastasized stomach carcinoma on the big screen, defining the tumors in the precise Latin poetry of histology. The patient, a fifty-eight-year-old woman named Anna Duran, had been referred to Jeremy because of &#x201c;unresponsive demeanor.&#x201d;<br><br>Jeremy found her initially sullen.

Why you not stay with me tonight in my cave.&#x2019; He seemed enthusiastic. And we were looking for adventure." Thus begins the story of how Marguerite van Geldermalsen a New Zealand-born nurse became the wife of Mohammad Abdallah Othman, a Bedouin souvenir-seller of the Manaja tribe, and lived with him and their children in a community of 100 families in the ancient caves of Petra in Jordan. Marguerite and a friend were traveling through the Middle East in 1978 when she met the charismatic Mohammad and decided that he was the man for her. Their home was a lofty&nbsp;2,000 year-old cave carved into the red rock of a hillside. She became the resident nurse and learned to live like the Bedouin cooking over fires, hauling water on donkeys, and drinking sweet black tea and over the years she became as much of a curiosity as the cave-dwellers to tourists. This is her extraordinary story.</p></p><p>Marguerite van Geldermalsen was widowed in 2002.

It's 1998, and a physicist in Cambridge, England, attempts to send a message backward in time. Earth is falling apart, and a government faction supports the project in hopes of diverting or avoiding the environmental disasters beginning to tear at the edges of civilization. It's 1962, and a physicist in California struggles with his new life on the West Coast, office politics, and the irregularities of data that plague his experiments. The story's perspective toggles between time lines, physicists, and their communities. <i>Timescape</i> presents the subculture and world of scientists in microcosm: the lab, the loves, the grappling for grants, the pressures from university and government, the rewards and trials of relationships with spouses, the pressures of the scientific race, and the thrill of discovery. <p> <i>Timescape</i> merits the tag "hard science fiction"; it tells the story of scientists, and readers can't help but learn something about tachyons and physics while reading it. Yet much of the story is about humanity: the men John Renfrew and Gordon Bernstein and their relationships--between husband and wife, lover and lover, English working class and upper class, professor and student, and academician and colleagues. </p><p> Winner of the Nebula Award in 1980 and the John W. Clark Award in 1981, <i>Timescape</i> offers readers a great yarn, in terms of both humanity and science.</p>1998. Earth is falling apart, on the brink of ecological disaster. But in England a tachyon scientist is attempting to contact the past, to somehow warn them of the misery and death their actions and experiments have visited upon a ravaged planet. <p> 1962. JFK is still president, rock 'n' roll is king, and the Vietnam War hardly merits front-page news. A young assistant researcher at a California university, Gordon Bernstein, notices strange patterns of interference in a lab experiment. Against all odds, facing ridicule and opposition, Bernstein begins to uncover the incredible truth... a truth that will change his life and alter history... the truth behind time itself.</p></p><h2>A Grimoire of Shadows: Witchcraft, Paganism, &amp; Magick</h2><p>For years it circulated among initiates of Wicca.

Night was falling. Soon the owls would lift into the air and vanish like smoke on a windy day, but for now their gazes fixed on the strange old man with the limp.He cocked his head, listening. The call was growing fainter. Sky Messenger propped his walking stick and continued on down the trail.He'd first heard the Voice when he'd seen eleven summers. Since that time, the great unrest came upon him every Moon of Falling Leaves. He would be sleeping warmly beneath his hides, his soul walking through springtime meadows with his Ancestors, when suddenly his eyes would jerk open, and he would sit up in bed. It always began as a low keening. When he heard it, he would jump to his feet and dash out into the cold darkness. On and on he would run, as fast as his bad legs would carry him, away from the village and down the forest trails where bears and wolves prowled.Four nights ago, he'd leaped from his hides, breathing as though slapped awake, and known the caller was close. The hair at the nape of his neck had stood on end. From far out in the trees, the Voicecame, clear and crisp, more real than ever before--<i>Odion ... Odion.</i> He'd thrown on his cape, for his old body needed it these days, and rushed outside into the icy woods. It was unlike any human voice he'd ever heard, composed of many notes, like an eerie song. And he knew it, knew the speaker, in the depths of his heart, as he had never known another human being.Sometimes he pursued the Voice all moon long, looking for it as though it were real. Speaking gently or shouting in desperation, he would limp along the trails like a madman. He used his crooked walking stick to probe beneath fallen logs, or stab into holes in the forest floor where supernatural creatures lived; or he would crouch in the underbrush for days, his eyes wide, sniffing the wind for that otherworldly scent he knew would someday be there. Listening. Always listening for that mysterious voice that called him by name, filling him with wild desires and a vague sweet gladness.His obsession frightened his children and grandchildren. His clan had begun to say that he was insane, that he was chasing his own afterlife soul that had wandered away into the forest and become lost. None of that mattered. He <i>knew</i> he had to find the caller and look him in the eyes.Sky Messenger stopped to take a breath and looked up into the overarching branches of a hickory tree. He especially enjoyed these rare autumn evenings when he could stand beneath the trees and hear them snapping and cracking as the night cooled.The Voice faded.Sky Messenger propped his walking stick and held his breath, listening. In the moonlight, the snow-coated trees had a bluish gleam that seemed to radiate outward into the air, turning it liquid and faintly silver. Deep autumn leaves rustled around his moccasins as he cupped a hand to his mouth and called, "Where are you?"He searched the forest until he spied movement among the shadows. Concentrating, he thought he saw a black silhouette, standing tall and straight, its arms open to the night sky. Heat flushed his face. Was it real? Was it a ... a man? Or did it have wings? Black wings that sleeked down its back? Or perhaps the hump was just a bulky Trader's pack?He slowly moved toward it. He was afraid of falling. His old bones had grown brittle, and he knew that a simple broken arm might kill him. As he sneaked closer, the Voice lowered its arms and turned toward him.<i>Odion. Are you coming?</i>For the first time since he'd seen eleven summers he was looking into the dark holes of its eyes. Terror made his hands tremble."Th-that was my childhood name. They call me Sky Messenger now."Hunched over, he limped toward the Forest Spirit, his ancient body aching. Every step was at once a threat and a gesture of love and need. The Voice seemed to sense it. Like all predators, they feared each other. It cocked its head, and its eyes caught the starlight and shimmered as though dusted with quartz crystals.A fleeting instant later, it dashed out into the trees with twigs cracking in its wake."No, wait! Come back!"Sky Messenger stumbled after it, thrashing wildly through the brush, trying to catch up. He chased it straight into a meadow where the starlight reflected so brilliantly from the snow that the Voice's dark silhouette seemed to be floating above the ground."What do you want? Why do you keep calling me? You've been calling me for sixty-five summers."The creature growled like a cornered wolf, its arms extended as though preparing to take flight.In a motion as old as predators themselves, Sky Messenger took a step backward, yielding the moment to his opponent, and slowly began to circle around the tree-lined edge of the meadow. He poked at rocks with his walking stick, and sniffed damp tree bark, precisely like the demented old man people claimed him to be. The Spirit kept cocking its head, watching curiously, and after a time it quieted and lowered its arms. But its quartz-dust eyes remained focused on Sky Messenger, charting his methodical progress around the meadow.It stunned him that the Spirit seemed suspicious and afraid. What could an old man do to harm a Spirit? Then again, maybe it wasn't harm the Spirit feared. Perhaps it was just the way of the chase. Run and feint. Let your prey catch up, then whirl around and snap at it, keep it at bay until the final moment. The final lunge for the throat.Sky Messenger saw his chance and dashed out into the meadow, heading directly for the Voice ... and the chase resumed.Time and again he cornered the creature and tried to force it to answer his questions before it darted away. He stumbled after it in some incomprehensible ancient dance. Was it just a man? Sometimes he thought so. But why would a strong young man let Sky Messengercatch him? The Voice ran until Sky Messenger was right on its heels; then it whirled around snarling. He would never have caught the Voice if it did not wish to be caught. Surely this was some Spirit game.He halted, breathing hard, and let his gaze drift over the brush and trees.<i>I'm here, Odion.</i>He saw it. The Voice stood just ahead, hidden behind a frost-covered dogwood. Its eyes gleamed through the dark weave of branches.<i>Come ... . Follow me.</i>It trotted away, repeatedly looking back over its shoulder, as if to make certain he was still behind; then it disappeared into the forest.Sky Messenger worked his way down a winding forest trail dappled with snow and frost-rimmed leaves, simultaneously fearing and eager for what he would next see."Where are you?" he called. "I've lost you."From the dark depths of the forest came the call--a long drawn-out wail, his name in the voice of a wolf, howled with chilling effect.Sky Messenger's bony fingers tightened around the knob of his walking stick. He was close now. Very close, and he dared not be afraid of what would come. He swallowed hard and limped forward.On the other side of a birch copse, the trail sloped upward to a high point overlooking a hilly country filled with great stretches of forests and shining creeks.<i>Odion.</i>There. On the trail below.The Voice let him get to within thirty paces, and started slowly walking away.Through endless towering trees, Sky Messenger followed, step after step, always twenty paces behind, until Elder Brother Sun rose red over the eastern horizon. As the air warmed, an exotic flowery fragrance wafted around him. His nostrils quivered. He took a deep breath, filling his lungs with the otherworldly sweetness, and his old heart began to slam against his ribs. <i>That scent!</i>In the distance, he saw flocks of birds gathered over a bridge, fluttering, waiting. All along the planks of the bridge, mice darted, their furred backs shining in the newborn light. There were other animals, too. A white-tailed doe, and a lean young wolf.At the sight of the wolf, tears traced warm lines down Sky Messenger's wrinkled cheeks. He had been running from this moment his entire life. He whispered, "Hello, old friend."The Voice stopped dead in the trail and let him advance to stand at its side. Sky Messenger shivered. He understood now.He was answering the last call, walking at the side of the only brother who truly mattered. The brother who had always been there, as unobtrusive as his own shadow, watching over him, fighting at his side on the darkest days."You can tell me now," he said, and took a breath to prepare himself. "What is your name?"The Voice hissed, the sound like a truce being broken by an arrow, and he thought he made out the word <i>Sonon</i>."Sonon?"<i>Yes, do you remember me, Odion?</i>Ancient memories flooded up from behind doors buried deep in his heart, doors Sky Messenger had kept barricaded for sixty-five summers. Behind them monsters still lived and breathed.He shook his head and stumbled backward. "No. No, I--I can't--!"<i>Remember, Odion. You must remember now. It's time.</i>All of the doors he had so carefully guarded vanished, and a sea of ghostly eyes started coming toward him.Shuddering, Sky Messenger sank down in the trail and squeezed his eyes closed. As the monsters surrounded him, terror swept him back in time to that long-ago day when this journey had truly started ... .Copyright � 2010 by W.

This is the moment a CIA director most dreads. <p>Weber turns to a charismatic (and unstable) young man named James Morris who runs the Internet Operations Center. He's the CIA's in-house geek. Weber launches Morris on a mole hunt unlike anything in spy fiction&#x2015;one that takes the reader into the hacker underground of Europe and America and ends up in a landscape of paranoia and betrayal. Like the new world of cyber-espionage from which it's drawn, <em>The Director</em> is a maze of deception and double dealing, about a world where everything is written in zeroes and ones and nothing can be trusted. The CIA has belatedly discovered that this is not your father&#x2019;s Cold War, and Weber must play catch-up, against the clock and an unknown enemy, in a game he does not yet understand.</p></p><p>David Ignatius is a prize-winning columnist for the Washington Post and has been covering the Middle East and the CIA for nearly three decades.

She gained her unique insight while married to Warren&#39;s son Peter for twelve years. David Clark holds degrees in both finance and law, and in the late seventies was the founding member of the original Buffettologists - a small group of early Berkshire shareholders who studied the investment methods of Warren Buffett. He is now the Managing Director of a private partnership that invests primarily in arbitrage situations.<b></b><p><b> Introduction </b> </p><p> In the chronicles of the investment life of Warren Buffett much has been written about his investment methods. Each and every investment he has ever made has been taken apart and analyzed in excruciating detail. David and I alone have written the books <i>Buffettology, The Buffettology Workbook, The New Buffettology, The Tao of Warren Buffett,</i> and <i>Warren Buffett and the Interpretation of Financial Statements</i> -- all on Warren's investment methods and all international best-sellers. </p><p> But what was sorely missing from the body of Warren Buffett literature was a book that addresses and discusses the brilliant way Warren has managed his life, his businesses, and the people who manage Berkshire Hathaway's 233,000 employees around the globe. Besides being a genius at investing, Warren Buffett is also a genius of a manager, with over eighty-eight CEO s of different companies reporting directly or indirectly to him. In modern business no man has managed a more highly talented group of managers, in so many diverse businesses, and delivered such spectacular results. In many ways Buffett's managerial record surpasses even his amazing investment record with Berkshire Hathaway, where <i>the company's operational annual net income</i> grew from $18 a share in 1979 to $4,093 a share in 2007. This equates to a compounding annual growth rate of 21.39 percent, a record that indicates that Warren and his managers are doing a fantastic job of minding the store. (In comparison, <i>Berkshire's investment portfolio</i> for the same period grew at an annual compounding rate of 19.78 percent, which means we can argue that as a manager Warren outperformed himself as an investor.) </p><p> In our quest to bring you all things Warren Buffett, we have written the first ever book that takes an in-depth look at Warren's management methods -- what they are, how they work, and how you can use them. We discuss the impact that Dale Carnegie had on Warren's life and how Carnegie's teachings helped transform Warren into the master manager he is today. </p><p> We have kept the book easy to read, with short chapters. The methods that Warren uses are simple and easy to understand, but, as you will see, their impact is powerful. </p><p> We look to the future and imagine many generations using Warren's enlightened management methods to inspire and motivate people of all ages to achieve their dreams and visions. </p><p> Mary Buffett and David Clark<br> July 1, 2009 Copyright � 2009 by Mary Buffett and David Clark</p><p><b></b></p><p><b> Overview </b> <i></i></p><p><i> Warren Buffett's Management Secrets</i><i> </i> </p><p> Once upon a time there was a slightly nerdish young man by the name of Warren Buffett, who, at the age of twenty, was frightened to death to stand up in front of people and speak to them. Then he discovered Dale Carnegie's course on public speaking and it changed his life. Not only did he develop the courage and skill to speak in front of groups of people, he learned how to make friends and motivate people. Warren considers his Carnegie education a life-changing event and the most important diploma he has ever received. </p><p> Once Warren was comfortable with public speaking, he also became a devotee of Dale's philosophy on interacting with people. He read and reread Carnegie's book <i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i> dozens of times, underlining it and memorizing entire passages. The book became his bible for dealing with people and one of the cornerstones of his management philosophy. </p><p> Was he successful? </p><p> Here is what A. L. Ueltschi, the founder and chairman of FlightSafety International Inc., the world's leading aviation training company, told author Robert P. Miles about Warren as his boss: "Leadership is really what a good manager is about. The letters of the word represent the qualities that a good manager should have: </p><blockquote> <b><i>L</i></b> is for loyalty and<br> <b><i>E</i></b> is for enthusiasm.<br> <b><i>A</i></b> stands for attitude, and<br> <b><i>D</i></b> is for discipline.<br> <b><i>E</i></b> stands for example -- you have to set a good example -- and<br> <b><i>R</i></b> is for respect.<br> <b><i>S</i></b> represents scholarliness, and<br> <b><i>H</i></b> is for honesty.<br> <b><i>I</i></b> and<br> <b><i>P</i></b> stand for integrity and pride. </blockquote> <p> "The thing I like best about Warren Buffett is that he possess all these qualities." </p><p> We will examine Warren's leadership qualities and how Warren synthesized what he learned into a winning management formula, and became not only the manager that other managers want to emulate, but also the second richest man in the world. </p><p> To facilitate the learning process, we've broken down Warren's management philosophy into the following five segments or steps -- each working with the others to create the perfect combination of management skills. </p><p> 1. Pick the Right Business </p><p> Warren has figured out that not all businesses are created equal. The first step to success is to own, manage, or work for the right business with the right economics working in its favor. That's how to get ahead of the game right from the start, whether you are an owner, a manager, or an employee. </p><p> 2. Delegate Authority </p><p> The second step is Warren's unique view on delegating authority, which has allowed him to grow Berkshire Hathaway from a small, failing textile company into a giant multinational conglomerate. </p><p> 3. Find a Manager with the Right Qualities </p><p> The third step is to know the qualities that are needed to manage an excellent business -- here Warren is looking for integrity, intelligence, and a passion for the business, which also happen to be the qualities that we need to cultivate in ourselvesto be successful managers. </p><p> 4. Motivate Your Workforce </p><p> Once the excellent business is found and the right manager is put into place, Warren has the job of motivating his managers to be all that they can be, so that the business, the manager, and the employees can be as productive as possible. Here we will spend time studying Warren's adaptation and expansion of Carnegie's methods. If there is a single skill that a manager should be great at, it is motivating others to achieve. Warren developed a specific set of motivational skills that have inspired his managers to hit one business home run after another and helped him build Berkshire Hathaway into the $150 billion market cap company that it is today. </p><p> 5. Managerial Axioms for Different Problems </p><p> And finally there are a number of specific Buffett managerial axioms for dealing with everything from managing leverage, to handling dishonest employees, to keeping costs low. </p><p> At the end of the book we will discuss a few "Warren-isms" that will help you manage your day-to-day life. Success in business and life usually go hand in hand, and Warren has some helpful hints that will help us improve our life management skills.

She has been acting for over forty years both on television and the West End stage.'You know what?' said Major Dexter Smythe to the octopus. 'You're going to have a real treat today if I can manage it.' <p>He had spoken aloud and his breath had steamed up the glass of his Pirelli mask. He put his feet down to the sand and stood up. The water reached to his armpits. He took off the mask and spat into it, rubbed the spit round the glass, rinsed it clean and pulled the rubber band of the mask back over his head. He bent down again.</p> <p>The eye in the mottled brown sack was still watching him carefully from the hole in the coral, but now the tip of a single small tentacle wavered hesitatingly an inch or two out of the shadows and quested vaguely with its pink suckers uppermost. Dexter Smythe smiled with satisfaction. Given time, perhaps one more month on top of the two during which he had been chumming up with the octopus, and he would have tamed the darling. But he wasn't going to have that month. Should he take a chance today and reach down and offer his hand, instead of the expected lump of raw meat on the end of his spear, to the tentacle - shake it by the hand, so to speak? No, Pussy, he thought. I can't quite trust you yet. Almost certainly other tentacles would whip out of the hole and up his arm. He only needed to be dragged down less than two feet, the cork valve on his mask would automatically close and he would be suffocated inside it or, if he tore it off, drowned. He might get in a quick lucky jab with his spear, but it would take more than that to kill Pussy. No. Perhaps later in the day. It would be rather like playing Russian roulette, and at about the same five-to-one-odds. It might be a quick, a whimsical way out of his troubles! But not now. It would leave the interesting question unsolved. And he had promised that nice Professor Bengry at the Institute. Dexter Smythe swam leisurely off towards the reef, his eyes questing for one shape only, the squat sinister wedge of a scorpion fish, or, as Bengry would put it, Scorpaena Plumieri.</p> <p>Major Dexter Smythe, OBE, Royal Marines (Retd), was the remains of a once brave and resourceful officer and of a handsome man who had made easy sexual conquests all his military life and particularly among the Wrens and Wracs and ATS who manned the com-munications and secretariat of the very special task force to which he had been attached at the end of his service career. Now he was fifty-four, slightly bald and his belly sagged in the Jantzen trunks. And he had had two coronary thromboses. His doctor, Jimmy Greaves (who had been one of their high poker game at Queen's Club when Dexter Smythe had first come to Jamaica), had half-jocularly described the later one, only a month before, as 'the second warning'. But, in his well-chosen clothes, his varicose veins out of sight and his stomach flattened by a discreet support belt behind an immaculate cummerbund, he was still a fine figure of a man at a cocktail party or dinner on the North Shore, and it was a mystery to his friends and neighbours why, in defiance of the two ounces of whisky and ten cigarettes a day to which his doctor had rationed him, he persisted in smoking like a chimney and going to bed drunk, if amiably drunk, every night.</p> <p>The truth of the matter was that Dexter Smythe had arrived at the frontier of the death-wish. The origins of this state of mind were many and not all that complex. He was irretrievably tied to Jamaica, and tropical sloth had gradually riddled him so that while outwardly he appeared a piece of fairly solid hardwood, under the varnished surface the termites of sloth, self-indulgence, guilt over an ancient sin and general disgust with himself had eroded his once hard core into dust. Since the death of Mary two years before, he had loved no one. He wasn't even sure that he had really loved her, but he knew that, every hour of the day, he missed her love of him and her gay, untidy, chiding and often irritating presence, and though he ate their canapes and drank their martinis, he had nothing but contempt for the international riff-raff with whom he consorted on the North Shore. He could perhaps have made friends with the soldier elements, the gentleman-farmers inland, or the plantation owners on the coast, the professional men and the politicians, but that would mean regaining some serious purpose in life which his sloth, his spiritual accidie, prevented, and cutting down on the bottle, which he was definitely unwilling to do. So Major Smythe was bored, bored to death, and, but for one factor in his life, he would long ago have swallowed the bottle of barbiturates he had easily acquired from a local doctor. The lifeline that kept him clinging to the edge of the cliff was a tenuous one. Heavy drinkers veer towards an exaggeration of their basic temperaments, the classic four - Sanguine, Phlegmatic, Choleric and Melancholic. The Sanguine drunk goes gay to the point of hysteria and idiocy. The Phlegmatic sinks into a morass of sullen gloom. The Choleric is the fighting drunk of the cartoonists who spends much of his life in prison for smashing people and things, and the Melancholic succumbs to self-pity, mawkishness and tears. Major Smythe was a Melancholic who had slid into a drooling fantasy woven around the birds and insects and fish that inhabited the five acres of Wavelets (the name he had given his small villa is symptomatic), its beach and the coral reef beyond. The fish were his particular favourites. He referred to them as 'people' and, since reef fish stick to their territories as closely as do most small birds, after two years he knew them all intimately, 'loved' them and believed that they loved him in return.</p> <p>They certainly knew him, as the denizens of zoos know their keepers, because he was a daily and a regular provider, scraping off algae and stirring up the sand and rocks for the bottom-feeders, breaking up sea eggs and urchins for the small carnivores and bringing out scraps of offal for the larger ones, and now, as he swam slowly and heavily up and down the reef and through the channels that led out to deep water, his 'people' swarmed around him fearlessly and expectantly, darting at the tip of the three-pronged spear they knew only as a prodigal spoon, flirting right up to the glass of the Pirelli and even, in the case of the fearless, pugnacious demoiselles, nipping softly at his feet and legs. Part of Major Smythe's mind took in all these brilliantly coloured little 'people', but today he had a job to do and while he greeted them in unspoken words - 'Morning, Beau Gregory' to the dark-blue demoiselle sprinkled with bright-blue spots, the 'jewel fish' that exactly resembles the starlit fashioning of a bottle of Worth's 'Vol de Nuit'; 'Sorry. Not today, sweetheart,' to a fluttering butterfly fish with false black 'eyes' on its tail and, 'You're too fat anyway, Blue Boy,' to an indigo parrot fish that must have weighed a good ten pounds - his eyes were searching for only one of his 'people' - his only enemy on the reef, the only one he killed on sight, a scorpion fish.</p> <p>Scorpion fish inhabit most of the southern waters of the world, and the 'rascasse' that is the foundation of bouillabaisse belongs to the family. The West Indian variety runs up to only about twelve inches long and perhaps a pound in weight. It is by far the ugliest fish in the sea, as if nature were giving warning. It is a mottled brownish grey with a heavy, wedge-shaped shaggy head. It has fleshy pendulous 'eyebrows' that droop over angry red eyes and a coloration and broken silhouette that are perfect camouflage on the reef. Though a small fish, its heavily toothed mouth is so wide that it can swallow whole most of the smaller reef fishes, but its supreme weapon lies in its erectile dorsal fins, the first few of which, acting on contact like hypodermic needles, are fed by poison glands containing enough tetrodotoxin to kill a man if they merely graze him in a vulnerable spot - in an artery, for instance, or over the heart or in the groin. They constitute the only real danger to the reef swimmer, far more dangerous than barracuda or shark, because, supremely confident in their camouflage and armoury, they flee before nothing except the very close approach of a foot or actual contact. Then they flit only a few yards on wide and bizarrely striped pectorals and settle again watchfully either on the sand, where they look like a lump of overgrown coral, or amongst the rocks and seaweed, where they virtually disappear. And Major Smythe was determined to find one, spear it and give it to his octopus to see if it would take or spurn it, see if one of the ocean's great predators would recognize the deadliness of another, know of its poison. Would the octopus consume the belly and leave the spines? Would it eat the lot and, if so, would it suffer from the poison? These were the questions Bengry at the Institute wanted answered and today, since it was going to be the beginning of the end of Major Smythe's life at Wavelets and though it might mean the end of his darling Octopussy, Major Smythe had decided to find out the answers and leave one tiny memorial to his now futile life in some dusty corner of the Institute's marine biological files.</p> <p>For, only a couple of hours earlier, Major Dexter Smythe's already dismal life had changed very much for the worse. So much for the worse that he would be lucky if, in a few weeks' time - time for the sending of cables from Government House to the Colonial Office, to be relayed to the Secret Service and thence to Scotland Yard and the Public Prosecutor, and for Major Smythe's transportation to London with a police escort - he got away with a sentence of imprisonment for life.</p> <p>And all this because of a man called Bond, Commander James Bond, who had turned up at ten thirty that morning in a taxi from Kingston.</p> <p>The day had started normally. Major Smythe had awoken from his Seconal sleep, swallowed a couple of Panadols (his heart condition forbade him aspirin), showered and skimped his breakfast under the umbrella-shaped sea-almonds and spent an hour feeding the remains of his breakfast to the birds. He then took his prescribed doses of anti-coagulant and blood-pressure pills and killed time with the Daily Gleaner until he could have his elevenses which, for months now, he had advanced to ten thirty. He had just poured himself the first of two stiff brandies and ginger ales, 'the drunkard's drink', when he heard the car coming up the drive.</p> <p>Luna, his coloured housekeeper, came out into the garden and announced, 'Gemmun to see you, Major.'</p> <p>'What's his name?'</p> <p>'Him doan say. Major. Him say to tell you him come from Govment House.'</p> <p>Major Smythe was wearing nothing but a pair of old khaki shorts and sandals. He said, 'All right, Luna. Put him in the living room and say I won't be a moment,' and went round the back way into his bedroom and put on a white bush shirt and trousers and brushed his hair. Government House! Now what the hell?</p> <p>As soon as he had walked through into the living-room and seen the tall man in the dark-blue tropical suit standing at the picture window looking out to sea, Major Smythe had somehow sensed bad news. Then, when the man had turned slowly to look at him with watchful, serious blue-grey eyes, he had known that this was officialdom, and when his cheery smile was not returned, inimical officialdom. A chill had run down Major Smythe's spine. 'They' had somehow found out.</p> <p>'Well, well. I'm Smythe. I gather you're from Government House. How's Sir Kenneth?'</p> <p>There was somehow no question of shaking hands. The man said, 'I haven't met him. I only arrived a couple of days ago. I've been out round the island most of the time. My name's Bond, James Bond. I'm from the Ministry of Defence.'</p> <p>Major Smythe remembered the hoary euphemism for the Secret Service. He said, with forced cheerfulness, 'Oh. The old firm?'</p> <p>The question had been ignored. 'Is there somewhere we can talk?'</p> <p>'Rather. Anywhere you like. Here or in the garden? What about a drink?' Major Smythe clinked the ice in the glass he still held in his hand.' Rum and ginger's the local poison. I prefer the ginger by itself. 'The lie came out with the automatic smoothness of the alcoholic.</p> <p>' No thanks. And here would be fine.' The man leaned 5negligently against the wide mahogany windowsill.</p> <p>Major Smythe sat down and threw a jaunty leg over the low arm of one of the comfortable planters' chairs he had had copied from an original by the local cabinet-maker. He pulled out the drink coaster from the other 1arm, took a deep pull at his glass and slid it, with a consciously steady hand, down into the hole in the wood. 'Well,' he said cheerily, looking the other man straight in the eyes,'what can I do for you? Somebody been up to some dirty work on the North Shore and you need a spare hand? Be glad to get into harness again. It's been a long time since those days, but I can still remember some of the old routines.'</p> <p>'Do you mind if I smoke?' The man had already got his cigarette case in his hand. It was a flat gun-metal one that would hold a round fifty. Somehow this small sign of a shared weakness comforted Major Smythe.</p> <p>'Of course, my dear fellow.' He made a move to get up, his lighter ready. 'It's all right, thanks.' James Bond had already lit his cigarette. 'No, it's nothing local. I want to, I've been sent out to ask you to recall your work for the Service at the end of the war.' James Bond paused and looked down at Major Smythe carefully. 'Particularly the time when you were working with the Miscellaneous Objectives Bureau.'</p> <p>Major Smythe laughed sharply. He had known it. He had known it for absolutely sure. But when it came out of this man's mouth, the laugh had been forced out of Major Smythe like the scream of a hit man. 'Oh Lord, yes. Good old MOB. That was a lark all right.' He laughed again. He felt the anginal pain, brought on by the pressure of what he knew was coming, build up across his chest. He dipped his hand into his trouser pocket, tilted the little bottle into the palm of his hand and slipped the white TNT pill under his tongue.

Yet the relationship between the two men did not end there. Far from it: in the years that followed, Logue was to play an even more important role at the monarch's side.<br><br><em>The King's War</em> follows that relationship through the dangerous days of Dunkirk and the drama of D-Day to eventual victory in 1945&#x2015;and beyond. Like the first book, it is written by Peter Conradi, a London <em>Sunday Times</em> journalist, and Mark Logue (Lionel's grandson), and again draws on exclusive material from the Logue Archive&#x2015;the collection of diaries, letters, and other documents left by Lionel and his feisty wife, Myrtle. This gripping narrative provides a fascinating portrait of two men and their respective families&#x2015;the Windsors and the Logues&#x2015;as they together face the greatest challenge in Britain's history. 8 page b&amp;w insert</p><p><p><strong>Peter Conradi</strong> is an author and journalist with the London <em>Sunday Times</em>.

This rich collection, compiled by her editor, Robert Giroux, is arranged in two parts, fiction and nonfiction.</p><p>Farrar, Straus and Giroux first published Elizabeth Bishop's <i>Collected Prose</i> in 1984, five years after the poet's death. It's now too late to ask whether this deeply private woman would have allowed such an act, let alone approved of the biographies and studies that have begun to appear. It's not too late, however, to praise her editor's decision to gather her fiction and nonfiction together. Without it we would not have the dreamlike "The Sea &amp; Its Shore" (in which a man hired to rid the beach of trash tries to make sense of each scrap of writing he comes upon) or memoirs such as "Primer Class," which begins, "Every time I see long columns of numbers, handwritten in a certain way, a strange sensation or shudder, partly aesthetic, partly painful goes through my diaphragm." Precise as ever, Bishop continues, "It is like seeing the dorsal fin of a large fish suddenly cut through the surface of the water." The collection's two standouts are "Efforts of Affection," a memoir of her mentor Marianne Moore, and the comic masterwork "The U.S.A. School of Writing." The latter is a sly recollection of her first job--at a deeply dodgy correspondence school. "Henry James once said that he who would aspire to be a writer must inscribe on his banner the one word 'Loneliness.' In the case of my students, their need was not to ward off society, but to get into it."Elizabeth Bishop (1911-79) remains one of America's most celebrated and admired postwar poets. She won both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award for her verse, and served as Poetry Consultant at the Library of Congress in 1949-50.<br></p><h2>Woodsong</h2><p>children</p><p>Gary Paulsen is one of the most honored writers of contemporary literature for young readers, author of three Newbery Honor titles, <i>Dogsong</i>, <i>Hatchet</i>, and <i>The Winter Room</i>. He has written over 100 books for adults and young readers. He divides his time among Alaska, New Mexico, Minnesota, and the Pacific.An autobiographical book that gives through spare but vivid language a look at a man who thought, because he was a hunter and a trapper, that he knew about the outdoors. Instead, he discovered he knew very little until he opened himself to the realities of predators and prey, and to the lessons taught to him by the animals he encountered and the sled dogs he trained and raced. This is not a life story, with dates and names and achievements, but rather Paulsen's reflections on the peculiarities and surprises of nature. Some of the lessons are violent and painful, brought on by the natural instincts of wild animals or Paulsen's own mistakes; others are touching or humorous, and convey a sharp sense of observation and awareness of the various personality traits of the dogs he has raised and run. And some are unexplainable--mysteries of nature that would seem incredible if written in a work of fiction. The anecdotal style and rhythmic, sometimes abrupt sentence structure demand close attention, and the switch in the last third of the book to Paulsen's day-by-day account of the Iditarod is sudden, though expected. The Iditarod story is intensely personal, focusing on Paulsen's thoughts, actions, and hallucinations during those 17 days rather than presenting a comprehensive view of the race and the competitors. Both segments of the book generate wonder at the abilities of animals and should introduce fans of Paulsen's fiction to a different type of writing. --Susan Schuller, Milwaukee Public Library<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Essential Herb-Drug-Vitamin Interaction Guide: The Safe Way to Use Medications and Supplements Together</h2><p><p><b>IF YOU DON&#x2019;T KNOW THE POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS OF MIXING HERBS, DRUGS, AND VITAMINS, YOU&#x2019;RE PUTTING YOURSELF AT RISK.<br></b><br>Did you know that . . .<br><br>Using echinacea to ward off a cold while you&#x2019;re taking Tylenol can severely damage your liver?<br>Mixing kava kava and alcohol can be toxic?<br>If you&#x2019;re diabetic and you take Panax ginseng, you can dangerously lower your blood sugar levels?<br>Drinking green tea can lead to false-positive results for some forms of cancer?<br>Taking St. John&#x2019;s wort while you&#x2019;re on birth control, prescription antidepressants, or certain heart medications can be deadly?<br>These are just a few of the warnings you need to know.

In the past, people didn&#x2019;t understand how herbs worked; they only knew that they did. Today we know a lot more about herbs, their contents and chemistry, their mechanisms and uses. We know that when used properly, numerous herbs can be useful health aids. We also know that they cannot be indiscriminately mixed with medications, for herbs and drugs do interact, and the interactions can be harmful.<br><br>For example, let&#x2019;s say that, like many other people, you take St. John&#x2019;s wort to relieve depression. Then you go to your doctor, who prescribes a medication to deal with a different health issue. No problem, right?<br>�&nbsp;Not if a birth control pill has been prescribed. Taking birth control pills when you&#x2019;re already taking St. John&#x2019;s wort can cause breakthrough bleeding and unplanned pregnancy.<br><br>� Not if an antidepressant, such as Zoloft, has been prescribed. St. John&#x2019;s wort plus Zoloft can trigger serotonin syndrome, which can cause confusion, fever, hallucinations, nausea, shaking, sweating, vomiting&#x2014;possibly even coma.<br><br>� Not if Lanoxin, a medication used to treat heart failure, has been prescribed. St. John&#x2019;s wort can weaken the drug&#x2019;s effectiveness and allow your heart to &#x201c;fade away.&#x201d;<br>Suppose you&#x2019;re one of the many people who take echinacea on a regular basis to prevent colds and other upper respiratory tract infections. It&#x2019;s a safe and natural way to ward off a stuffy nose, scratchy throat, and endless bouts of coughing, right?<br>� Not if you&#x2019;re taking Tylenol for pain, or statin drugs, such as Zocor and Lipitor, for elevated cholesterol. Combining any of these medicines with echinacea can severely damage your liver.<br><br>� Not if you ever want to use aspirin, ibuprofen, Celebrex, or other widely used painkillers. Mixing echinacea with these popular pills can increase the likelihood of dangerous uncontrolled bleeding.<br><br>� Not if your doctor prescribes Lodine for your arthritis. Lodine plus echinacea can lead to severe gastrointestinal problems, including nausea, vomiting, and gastritis.<br>Eager to keep your mind sharp and ward off Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease, you diligently take ginkgo biloba every day. A wise precaution, right?<br>� Not if you ever need to use Glucotrol, DiaBeta, or certain other drugs to treat diabetes. Ginkgo biloba can interfere with the action of these medicines and send your blood sugar out of control.<br><br>� Not if you ever need to take antidepressants like Elavil or Norpramin, or antibiotics such as Cipro. Mixing any of these drugs with ginkgo biloba makes you more likely to have a seizure.<br>Herbs can be wonderful health aids. But dire results may ensue when certain herbs and standard medications are mixed. Odds are you&#x2019;re not aware of the thousands of herb&#x2013;drug combinations that can be harmful. And, unfortunately, your doctor may not be aware of the risks either.<br><b>It's Not a Trivial Problem</b><br><br>It&#x2019;s estimated that 60 million Americans are taking herbs for their headaches, back pain, arthritis, menstrual difficulties, insomnia, depression, anxiety, menopausal symptoms, sexual difficulties, and numerous other problems. Millions of these people are also taking medications with their herbs.<br><br>The frightening truth is that an estimated 15 million Americans are at risk of dangerous herb&#x2013;drug interactions. But who&#x2019;s informing them of the potential dangers? Typically, no one. An article appearing in the <i>Journal of the American College of Cardiology</i> in 2002 noted that one&#x2013;third of patients use herbs, &#x201c;yet most practicing physicians have little knowledge of herbal remedies or their effects.&#x201d;<br><b>The Vital Information Few Health Professionals Know</b><br><br>An alarm has been quietly ringing for years. Articles warning of potentially dangerous interactions between common herbs and standard drugs&#x2014;both prescription and over&#x2013;the&#x2013;counter&#x2014;periodically appear in cardiology journals, cancer journals, family practice journals, anesthesia journals, nursing journals, emergency medicine journals, pharmacology journals, even dental journals. Over and over again, the authors of these articles emphasize the problems that can arise when drugs are prescribed for people who take herbs, then lament the fact that most doctors know so little about herbs and what happens when they are mixed with medicines. But few seem to be listening.<br><br>What exactly can go wrong? Herbs can &#x201c;harm&#x201d; drugs by interfering with their absorption, reducing their effectiveness inside the body, increasing their effectiveness (which is like taking a drug overdose), and/or boosting their harmful side effects. They can also:<br>� combine with drugs (or other herbs) to create new side effects<br>� alter the results of many laboratory tests<br>�&nbsp;worsen existing diseases<br>�&nbsp;trigger potentially dangerous interactions with foods and other supplements<br><br>Yet most people are completely unaware of this.<br><b>If You&#x2019;re Taking an Herb, Beware the Medicine</b><br><br>If you&#x2019;re taking chaparral, comfrey, echinacea, kava kava, or scullcap, an alarm bell should ring if your doctor prescribes a statin drug for your elevated cholesterol. Mixing Lipitor with any of these herbs can trigger potentially fatal liver damage.<br><br>If you&#x2019;re taking chamomile, feverfew, garlic, ginger, or passion flower, beware of using NSAIDs for your arthritis pain. Combining NSAIDs with any of these herbs can cause intestinal bleeding.<br><br>If you&#x2019;re taking borage seed oil, fennel oil, ginkgo biloba, St. John&#x2019;s wort, or wormwood, think twice before taking antidepressants. When antidepressants are mixed with any of these herbs, your risk of seizures can increase markedly.<br><br>If you&#x2019;re taking aloe, buckthorn, cascara, Chinese rhubarb, licorice, or senna, beware if your doctor prescribes Vascor for your angina. Adding Vascor to any of these herbs can trigger an irregular heartbeat, which is a potentially fatal condition.<br><b>And There&#x2019;s More You Need to Know</b><br><br>Herb&#x2013;drug interactions are only the beginning of what you need to know to use herbs safely. Many herbs can also alter the outcome of lab tests and interact in harmful ways with existing diseases, foods, and other supplements.<br><br><b>Herbs and Lab Tests</b><br>Taking certain herbs can cause various lab values to rise or fall&#x2014;and even if it&#x2019;s only a minor, temporary change, it can distort a doctor&#x2019;s diagnosis or treatment plan. Here are just a few of the herbs that can alter the results of lab tests.<br>�&nbsp;Black psyllium, used for constipation, can lower the results of tests of blood sugar levels.<br><br>�&nbsp;Bladderwrack, used for arthritis and thyroid disorders, can increase the results of tests of thyroid-stimulating hormone levels.<br><br>� Cascara, used as a laxative, can discolor urine, interfering with tests dependent on the color of urine when it's exposed to various substances.<br><br>� Green tea, used for stomach upset, diarrhea, and headaches, can increase bleeding time and prompt false&#x2013;positive results on tests for serum urate and certain cancers.<br><br>� Juniper, used for stomach upset, heartburn, and urinary tract infections, can interfere with urine tests by discoloring the urine.<br><br>� Lavender, used for insomnia and loss of appetite, can depress the results of cholesterol tests.<br><br>� Mate, used for depression, ulcers, and inflammation, causes false readings in laboratory tests of uric acid and creatinine in the blood, and tests for the tumors known as neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma.<br><br>� Motherwort, used for heart problems, can lower the results of thyroid tests.<br><b>Herbs and Diseases</b><br>And what if you&#x2019;re already sick? Did you know that taking herbs might make your condition worse? For example:<br><br>� Capsicum (cayenne), which is often used to improve digestion, can irritate the gastrointestinal tract. This makes the herb potentially dangerous for those with infectious or inflammatory gastrointestinal problems, such as irritable bowel syndrome.<br><br>� Echinacea, used for colds, viruses, and other problems, can pump up the autoimmune process. This makes the herb potentially harmful for those suffering from multiple sclerosis and other diseases involving immune system reactions and inflammation. Echinacea can also be detrimental to those with diabetes, HIV infections, or allergies.<br><br>� Guarana, used for weight loss and fatigue, may aggravate gastric and duodenal ulcers.<br><br>� Licorice root, used for ulcers, bronchitis, colic, and numerous other ailments, can make it harder for diabetics to keep their blood sugar under control, rob potassium stores, and worsen both hypertension and erectile dysfunction.<br><br>�&nbsp;Panax ginseng, used for anxiety, nerve pain, and insomnia, can lower blood sugar, which may be dangerous for diabetics. The herb can also interfere with blood coagulation, which can be detrimental to those with bleeding conditions, such as hemophilia. Siberian ginseng can increase blood pressure, which is harmful to those who already have hypertension, and it can increase the severity of both mania and schizophrenia.<br><b>Herbs and Foods</b><br>Then there are herb&#x2013;food interactions that can harm you in subtle ways. For example:<br>�&nbsp;Blond psyllium, used for constipation, can decrease the absorption of nutrients from the foods you eat by speeding food through the digestive tract and cutting back on the time available for nutrient absorption.<br><br>� Guar gum, used as a laxative and a cholesterol&#x2013;reducing agent, can a...</p><h2>James McNair&#39;s Pie Cookbook</h2><p>French chefs are the masters of tortes and other pastries, and Italians make the world's best ice creams, but no one surpasses American cooks when it comes to making pies.

Despite the suicidal thumps and flutters that gained it nothing and left it pitifully outside its hope, the misguided bird never learned a lesson or gave up on its headlong, full-steam shortcut to sanctuary, never stopped, kept at the foolishness for hours. Mason was home from his final year of law school, visiting his mother and enjoying her flapjacks and rich casseroles for a weekend, waiting for his older brother, Gates, to arrive so they could saw up a maple tree that had blown over in the front yard and stack it into winter firewood. By the time Gates pulled in the gravel drive at eleven thirty, Mason had finished two cups of coffee, napped, read three issues of the <i>Stuart Enterprise</i> and carted the kerosene heater from the basement to its spot near the couch, even though there was no fuel in it and the weather wouldn&#x2019;t turn cold for another month or so. Soon after he heard Gates cut his Corvette&#x2019;s ignition, Mason noticed that the bird had quit its sallies and was stuck in a holly bush next to the window, one wing draped across a run of green, prickly leaves, its beak gapped, its head listing and its feet dangling, unable to take hold of anything.<br><br>Gates opened the mudroom door but didn&#x2019;t move too far past the threshold, let out his neck like a terrapin leaving its armor to get a better view of Mason and his mother. &#x201c;Hello, Mama,&#x201d; he said in a voice a few notches above normal.<br><br>&#x201c;Gates,&#x201d; she said, not looking up from her kitchen work. She was peeling green baking apples, circling off the skin in deft turns and cuts that went from stem to bottom without a hitch.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;re you cooking?&#x201d; he asked, leaning against the doorjamb.<br><br>&#x201c;A pie.&#x201d; The two words were absolutely neutral, ciphers. &#x201c;The phone not workin&#x2019; where you were at last night?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry; I know I promised I&#x2019;d call when I can&#x2019;t make it home. You forgive me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s common courtesy, Gates&#x2014;if you&#x2019;re living under my roof you could at least let me know where you are. Twenty-seven years old, and it&#x2019;s the only thing I ask from you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It won&#x2019;t happen again.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps you should ground him or take away TV privileges,&#x201d; Mason joked, trying to lighten the mood.<br><br>&#x201c;There you go,&#x201d; Gates said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;ll keep me on the straight and narrow.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You ready to get started?&#x201d; Mason asked, bending over to retie his shoes.<br><br>&#x201c;Sure. Yep. Ready, ready, ready. Ready as can be.&#x201d; Gates was wearing a Washington Redskins jersey with the name &#x201c;Hunt&#x201d; stenciled across the back in gold block letters. Five inches over six feet tall, he didn&#x2019;t fit well into the doorframe. &#x201c;Mason, man, I need you to run an errand with me before we take care of the tree, and then we&#x2019;re right back here lickety-split.&#x201d; He glanced at their mother. She still didn&#x2019;t look in his direction.<br><br>&#x201c;An errand?&#x201d; Mason repeated.<br><br>&#x201c;You boys be careful with the saw,&#x201d; Sadie Grace Hunt said from the kitchen. &#x201c;Chain saws are dangerous, Gates.&#x201d; She finally made eye contact with him.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; Gates answered. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need to worry about us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And if you&#x2019;re goin&#x2019; somewhere with Mason&#x201d;&#x2014;she held the paring knife in front of her, pointing it at the ceiling&#x2014;&#x201c;you let him drive, you hear?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If it&#x2019;ll make you happy, then I&#x2019;d be delighted to have my little brother chauffeur me around.&#x201d; He winked at Mason, promised his mom he&#x2019;d be back for a piece of warm pie and headed out the door.<br><br>Mason was a large man as well, two inches shorter than his brother and not as thick through the shoulders and trunk, but substantial enough that the Corvette&#x2019;s passenger seat was uncomfortable. The shape hit him all wrong, and he had trouble with his knees. He didn&#x2019;t attempt the safety belt. &#x201c;Damn, Gates, what&#x2014;you just start distilling the hooch in your car, cut out the middleman? It smells like a speakeasy in here.&#x201d; There was a plastic Star Wars cup&#x2014;a faded fast-food giveaway&#x2014;resting on the console; the contents were yellowish green, SunDrop and vodka without any ice to dilute the potency.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll roll the windows down and drive real fast.&#x201d; Gates nudged a cassette with his index finger and a mechanism eased it from sight, inhaling it into the dash. He had recorded a Huey Lewis and the News album onto the tape, and &#x201c;I Want a New Drug&#x201d; came on mid-refrain. &#x201c;While we&#x2019;re on the subject, can I offer you a little nip?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got vodka and a bottle of Wild Turkey Denny gave me for my birthday.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pass,&#x201d; Mason said. &#x201c;Thanks just the same. It&#x2019;s a bit early, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; The question didn&#x2019;t have any bite in it, wasn&#x2019;t a rebuke. He grinned at his brother.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m grandfathered in for the entire day, a carryover from last night. So long as you don&#x2019;t stop, it&#x2019;s just a continuation, not the same as drinking for breakfast or somethin&#x2019; pathetic and alcoholic.&#x201d; Remarkably, besides the odor and a few aggravated blood vessels in his eyes, Gates seemed fairly level. An occasional syllable was spit-heavy, but that was about it. &#x201c;Our pal Robbie Hanes is leavin&#x2019; for the Navy, so we had a throwdown yesterday for him at the Woolwine Ruritan building. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m behind schedule&#x2014;the party took us hostage and wouldn&#x2019;t let us go.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d have never pegged Robbie for duty on the high seas.&#x201d;<br><br>Gates reached under his seat and located a Crown Royal bag, a deep-purple felt sack with bold yellow stitching and matching yellow drawstrings. He set the bag in his lap and took out a vial of cocaine and an elaborate spoon, the spoon either silver or pewter, in the shape of a mermaid, her hair serving as a grip, her toes clutching a tiny scoop. &#x201c;I need to boost my shit, brother. I&#x2019;m assuming you&#x2019;re still not interested?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If I tried it, I&#x2019;d probably like it way too much. In no time at all, I&#x2019;d be pissing myself and scavenging butts from ashtrays at the bus terminal. Quoting Timmy Leary at the homeless shelter. Thanks just the same.&#x201d; Mason turned down the music. &#x201c;Perhaps we&#x2019;d be wise to get out of Mom&#x2019;s sight before you start doing that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Only take a sec.&#x201d; Gates dipped the spoon into the powder, raised it to his nose and snorted&#x2014;hard&#x2014;three times.<br><br>&#x201c;By the way, why does everyone I know carry his dope in a Crown Royal bag? Or the cassette cover for an Allman Brothers tape? Can you explain that to me? I think the Supreme Court&#x2019;s decided the cops have probable cause to search whenever they spot either of those in a car, regardless of the circumstances.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You have a better suggestion?&#x201d; Gates wiped his nose, then sipped his drink. &#x201c;The bag&#x2019;s a pretty damn fine creation.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;True. Can&#x2019;t argue with you there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You like the album?&#x201d; Gates asked. &#x201c;Huey Lewis and the News?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah. It&#x2019;s okay, though it&#x2019;s a shame they don&#x2019;t get any more airtime than they do. And I always feel like Huey might be sort of pulling our leg musically.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Too much schoolin&#x2019;, I&#x2019;m sorry to say, has made you into a boring smart-ass.&#x201d; Gates fired the engine and they crept down the gravel drive, the car chugging and straining in first gear, the tachometer barely registering because Gates didn&#x2019;t want to risk nicking the paint with kicked-up gravel.<br><br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;re we going?&#x201d; Mason asked. &#x201c;What kind of mischief are you dragging me into?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing too tough, I promise. Robbie&#x2019;s leavin&#x2019; behind a nice dresser, and he said I could have it. You and me are going to meet Claude and him in Woolwine, load the dresser onto Claude&#x2019;s pickup and haul it to Denise&#x2019;s trailer.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How are you two doing? You and Denise, I mean?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Everything&#x2019;s cool. She got a promotion at work&#x2014;off the floor and into the office&#x2014;and she finally finished her associate&#x2019;s degree. Looks like a million bucks, still crazy about me.&#x201d; He made a goofy face after the last declaration. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re thinkin&#x2019; about maybe considering buying a house together. The old Mabe home is for sale. I love that place&#x2014;it&#x2019;s on five acres, has a nice pond and a humongous porch for cookouts and warm-weather drinkin&#x2019;. Man, you could just put the speakers in the windows, grill a steak, invite friends by. Only problem is that I need my luck to improve so I can pull my part, you know? I&#x2019;m hopin&#x2019; this insurance job with State Farm comes through, so I can quit living fuckin&#x2019; hand to mouth.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good for you. I think the world of her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Me too.&#x201d;<br><br>Mason wanted to maneuver more space for his knees and shins, but the seat was at its limit, had no play in it. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll take us two hours to drive to Woolwine, load the dresser, then drive to Denise&#x2019;s and unload, don&#x2019;t you figure?&#x201d; He wriggled into a...</p><h2>Cooking with Foods That Fight Cancer</h2><p>From the bestselling authors of <b>Foods That Fight Cancer </b>comes the companion cookbook.<br><br><b>Foods That Fight Cancer </b>has sold more than 180,000 copies across Canada and has kick-started a revolution in our understanding of the cancer-fighting properties of food.

Her 1980 near-death experience, the subject of several books, has been featured on television shows, including&nbsp;<i>Good Morning America.</i>Folk artist Valentine seems to strive to emulate Jan Karon in this first novel, but is more aptly compared to Thomas Kinkade, another artist whose recent novel takes place in a New England community eerily like Dorsetville, which is Valentine's setting. In this town that time forgot, Catholic priest Father James frets over the archdiocese's decision to close down his church, leaving his aging parish without a place to worship. With the exception of some surprisingly mean-spirited depictions of Dorsetville's Congregationalists and a few other minor characters, Valentine offers a cast of saints: a young family fighting cancer, an elderly prayer warrior and several kind-underneath-it-all curmudgeons. Beginning on Ash Wednesday and ending on Easter Sunday, the novel is basically an introduction to these characters, which is to be expected this is the first in a series of Dorsetville books. Valentine favors redundancy, sometimes repeating information as if it were new. Moreover, the "miracle" at the end is confusing and appears from nowhere, as do a number of other plot contrivances such as, for example, the sudden appearance of a long-lost relative of the prayer warrior. Still, Valentine's prose is readable, and unlike most Christian fiction, this novel features devout Catholics, who resemble their fictional Protestant counterparts in every way except one: they drink. (When Father James is offered coffee heavily spiked with Jack Daniels, he enthusiastically accepts.) While Valentine's portrayal of the Catholic Church is undoubtedly sugarcoated, some readers will relish her prettified vision. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Looking for Alibrandi</h2><p>For as long as Josephine Alibrandi can remember, it&#x2019;s just been her, her mom, and her grandmother. Now it&#x2019;s her final year at a wealthy Catholic high school. The nuns couldn&#x2019;t be any stricter&#x2014;but that doesn&#x2019;t seem to stop all kinds of men from coming into her life.<br><br>Caught between the old-world values of her Italian grandmother, the nononsense wisdom of her mom, and the boys who continue to mystify her, Josephine is on the ride of her life. This will be the year she falls in love, the year she discovers the secrets of her family&#x2019;s past&#x2014;and the year she sets herself free.<br><br>Told with unmatched depth and humor, this novel&#x2014;which swept the pool of Australian literary awards and became a major motion picture&#x2014;is one to laugh through and cry with, to cherish and remember.</p><p>Seventeen-year-old Josephine Alibrandi is no stranger to conflict. If she's not caught between her strict single mom and her even stricter grandmother, then she's trying to choose between wealthy good boy John Barton and working-class bad boy Joseph Coote. Josephine is always in trouble with the nuns at her Catholic school (who everyone calls "penguins because of them wearing wimples and all that <i>Sound of Music</i> gear") because she fights with native Australian kids over her mixed Australian/Italian heritage. Just when she thinks her situation couldn't possibly get more complicated, her mysterious, long-lost biological father comes back and Josephine must decide if it's worth getting to know this person who abandoned her and her mother. But through it all--including a startling revelation from her grandmother and the suicide of a close friend--Josephine manages to hold on to her sense of humor, as in this reflective moment: "I could have been a model for Hot Pants. Except that when I finally put my glasses on, reality set in. Hot Pants would have to wait." <p> Award-winning Australian author Melina Marchetta has created a strong and sassy role model in Josephine, whom girls with growing pains on both sides of the Pacific will love. With its accurate and insightful portrayal of a young woman's coming of age, <i>Looking for Alibrandi</i> will have female teens waiting eagerly for Marchetta's next novel.

It is capable of creating curves with edges. It is somewhat similar to a band saw, but unlike band saws, in which the saw blade is a continuous loop, scroll saws use saw blades similar to those of coping saws and operate through a quick reciprocating up and down motion. ~~~ A scroll saw has two main advantages when compared to a band saw. The first is that the blade can be removed and placed in situ through a pre-drilled starting hole. This feature allows interior cutouts to be made without creating an entry slot for the blade through the edge of the workpiece. Second, a scroll saw can cut significantly more intricate curves. ~~~ Many different brands of scroll saws are on the market today. Notable ones include Excalibur (made in Taiwan), RBI (made in the USA), Hegner (made in Germany), Eclipse (made in the USA), and DeWalt (originally made in Canada, but now made in Taiwan). There are also a number of less expensive scroll saws manufactured in Asia, including those from Delta, Dremel (Bosch), Craftsman, Ryobi, and others.</p><p></p><h2>The Anxiety Cure</h2><p>Panic Anxiety is the number one mental health problem for women and second only to drug abuse among men.

Harris describes her role as theater critic for the <i>New York Amsterdam News </i>and editor at then burgeoning<i> Essence </i>magazine<i>; </i>star-studded parties in the South of France; drinks at Mikell&#x2019;s, a hip West Side club; and the simple joy these extraordinary people took in each other&#x2019;s company. The book is framed by Harris&#x2019;s relationship with Sam Floyd, a fellow professor at Queens College, who introduced her to Baldwin.<br> <br>More than a memoir of friendship and first love <i>My Soul Looks Back</i> is a carefully crafted, intimately understood homage to a bygone era and the people that made it so remarkable.</p><p>Jessica B. Harris holds a PhD from NYU, teaches English at Queens College, and lectures internationally. The author of the memoir <i>My Soul Looks Back</i> as well as twelve cookbooks, her articles have appeared in <i>Vogue</i>, <i>Food &amp; Wine, Essence</i>, and <i>The New Yorker</i>, among other publications; she has made numerous television and radio appearances and has been profiled in<i> The New York Times. </i>Considered one of the preeminent scholars of the food of the African Diaspora, Harris has been inducted into the James Beard Who&#x2019;s Who in Food and Beverage in America, received an honorary doctorate from Johnson &amp; Wales University and recently helped the Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture to conceptualize its cafeteria.My Soul Looks Back <br>Caldo Gallego&#x2014;Galician White Bean Soup<br> <br>I first tasted caldo gallego on a trip to Santiago de Compostela more years ago than I want to count. It was love at first slurp: the combination of the slightly spicy chorizo sausage, the bland starch of the potato, and the tang of the greens was perfectly suited to that northern Spanish town where they boast they have made rainfall an art form. I was thrilled to discover it on the menu at El Faro, where many chowed down on shrimp in green sauce and other shellfishy delights. It rapidly became my go-to order: comfort in a bowl. Even today, one spoonful takes me time-traveling back to the scarred wooden booths in the restaurant&#x2019;s back room and reminds me of my youth.<br> <br>&#x2013; Serves six &#x2013;<br> <br>1 ham hock (about 1/2 pound)<br> <br>2 tablespoons olive oil<br> <br>1 medium yellow onion, cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices<br> <br>1/4 pound chorizo, cut into 1/4-inch-thick rounds<br> <br>3/4 pound Yukon Gold potatoes (about 2 medium), peeled and cut into 3/4-inch-thick cubes<br> <br>2 cups small white turnips, roughly chopped<br> <br>2 cans cannellini beans and their liquid<br> <br>4 cups chopped kale<br> <br>Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br> <br>Prepare the ham hock by cooking it in water to cover for 2 hours.

Readable and convincing, the book is divided into four sections:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Section One</i> deals with four basic errors usually committed by those who attack the historicity of the New Testament.</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Section Two</i> defends the accuracy of the New Testament documents, using tests which are commonly applied to any ancient document.</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Section Three</i>, entitled "God Closes In," is a powerful defense of the truly divine and truly human nature of Christ.</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Section Four</i> clearly shows that if Jesus were not the Son of God, the only other alternatives are either liar or lunatic.</p><p>The book includes the transcript of a panel discussion in which Dr. Montgomery convincingly argues from the above four points to demonstrate their application for the reader. Here is excellent material for class discussion or individual study, particularly suited to helping young people combat humanistic concepts of the Bible and Christianity.</p></p><p>size : 5.2 x 8</p><h2>Full Service: My Adventures in Hollywood and the Secret Sex Lives of the Stars. Scotty Bowers and Lionel Friedberg</h2><p>Scotty Bowers, a dashing young ex-Marine exuding sex appeal, arrived in Hollywood in 1946 and quickly caught the attention of many of the town&#39;s stars. Working out of a gas station on Hollywood Boulevard, Bowers soon became the go-to guy for anyone looking for a bespoke sexual partner; no matter how outlandish the tastes, Scotty could find someone for everyone...In his thirty years &#39;tricking&#39; and arranging tricks for LA&#39;s rich and famous, Bowers went to bed with thousands of people and engineered sexual liaisons of all flavours for countless more. Full Service is the ultimate guilty pleasure, revealing for the first time the shadow lives of the people who created popular culture, told by the man who was so central to fulfilling their desires.</p><p>Scotty Bowers moved to LA after WWII and spent years as a bartender, confidante and gigolo to a host of Hollywood icons. Now eighty-eight years old, Bowers still works as a bartender at private functions in Hollywood. Lionel Friedberg is an Emmy Award-winning producer, director and writer.Preface<br> Although I&#x2019;m not a shy man I have always been reticent to reveal details about what I have done, mainly to respect the privacy of those whose lives have intersected with mine. But, if the truth be told, over the years many people have told me to write about my experiences and share them with others. A few decades ago my good buddy Tennessee Williams began writing his own account of my life but before it saw the light of day I told him to destroy it. Now, as I take stock of myself in my twilight years I&#x2019;ll be eighty-nine on my next birthday I feel compelled to share my story.<br><br> I reached this decision not long ago as I was driving east along Hollywood Boulevard. I had been to see a friend in Westwood and I was on my way to one of the two houses I own to pick up my mail. It was a perfect Southern Californian summer afternoon. The traffic wasn&#x2019;t too bad and my dog, Baby, happily bounded from one side of the rear seat to the other, thrusting her nose out of the windows. We passed Mann&#x2019;s Chinese Theatre, where throngs of tourists gathered in the courtyard to gaze at autographs and handprints of their favorite stars enshrined in concrete. People dressed up as characters from a multitude of blockbuster movies wafted among the crowds. Farther along the block, visitors gathered in the forecourt of the Kodak Theatre to admire the grand gallery where, once every year, the famous red carpet welcomes stars to the Academy Awards presentation. The El Capitan Theatre across the road was a riot of twinkling lights and more surging multitudes. It was just another average day in Hollywood.<br><br> Even for me, after all these years, the very name of Hollywood conjures up images of a fantastic world of make-believe. It&#x2019;s a world that throbs with energy, excitement, indulgence, even decadence. This is a crazy, zany, wonderful, topsy-turvy town sandwiched between a blistering desert and the vast Pacific Ocean. It has been my home for nearly seven decades. I have enjoyed a fabulous life here ever since I put down my roots following my discharge from the U.S. Marines at the end of World War II. I love this place and all the people in it. The story that I am going to tell could only have happened here. This is a gathering place of lost souls, of eccentrics, of people who don&#x2019;t follow the mainstream of anything.<br><br> As my car purred along Hollywood Boulevard I crossed Highland Avenue. I glanced around and realized how much things have changed since the early days. The old clanging streetcars are long gone. The shows that run in places like the Pantages Theatre are very different from what they used to be. Buildings have come and gone. The sidewalk still shimmers with inlaid terrazzo and brass stars that honor the many talented people who have worked in the film, television, radio, and music industries. Where bejeweled and fur-clad women once strolled arm in arm with tall, handsome men in tuxedos, there are now mainly tourists during the day and, after sundown, drunks, drug pushers, and the homeless. I drove on for a couple of miles. The crowds thinned out until the sidewalks were empty. When I reached Van Ness Avenue I pulled over. As Baby&#x2019;s face appeared over my shoulder she licked my ear. She was curious. Why had we stopped? Her wagging tail thudded against the seat behind me. How could I explain it to her? I tugged at her muzzle and stared at the intersection, now the site of major construction work.<br><br> A new fire station for the Los Angeles Fire Department was rising there. Like a floodgate suddenly opening, a million memories enveloped me. This very spot, this place where cranes, concrete mixers, and metal scaffolding now stand, is where it all began for me. A little gas station once occupied that corner. Shortly after I first got here I worked there as a young pump attendant. But it didn&#x2019;t take me long to learn to do more than just pump gas. Through a series of extraordinary incidents I became enmeshed in a wild world of sexual intrigue the likes of which few people can even begin to imagine.<br><br> Over the years more Hollywood personalities secretly congregated at that little gas station than anywhere else in town. It was a scene that saw as much furious action as the busiest studio back lot. The place became a magnet for those in quest of carnal thrills and escapism of every kind. A cavalcade of movie stars and others were attracted to the station like the proverbial moth to a flame. I became the go-to guy in town for arranging whatever people desired. And everybody&#x2019;s needs were met. Whatever folks wanted, I had it. I could make all their fantasies come true. No matter how outrageous or offbeat people&#x2019;s tastes, I was the one who knew how to get them exactly what they were after. Straight, gay, or bi; male or female; young or old I had something for everyone. The vice squad and the press were constantly lurking on the periphery, eagerly waiting to pounce. But I always managed to elude them.<br><br> The gas station was the portal that eventually took me into an exclusive world where high-class sex was everything. I&#x2019;ve had many occupations during my life but, to be honest, what really drove me was a desire to keep people happy. And the way I did that was through sex. Arranging sexual liaisons for folks from all walks of life became my raison d&#x2019;�tre. When I first arrived here the stars were owned by the studios, which were heavily invested in them.<br><br>Naturally, they needed to protect their investments. But people still wanted to have sex. And I was there to help them get it. Also, you have to remember that there were lots of gay people working at the studios at the time. Those behind the camera could be more open in their private lives but the actors and major directors and producers had morals&#x201d; clauses in their contracts, which they would have violated by being openly known as gay or bisexual.<br><br> Eventually I changed jobs. I moved on from the gas station to become one of the busiest bartenders in Los Angeles. In that capacity I gained access to the inner sanctums of Hollywood royalty. I moved in the highest of circles. Nothing was out of bounds for me. Those were amazing, intoxicating days, wildly erotic and carefree. Such a time can never come again. The lusty activities and vagabond lifestyle we once enjoyed in this town were unique to our time.<br><br> As I sat in the car that summer afternoon with Baby I became aware of the passing of an incalculable number of years. I felt myself reminiscing about dear and wonderful friends, all long departed. Oh, Kate, Spence, Judy, Tyrone, George, Cary, Rita, Charles, Randolph, Edith, Vivien, I thought . . . where are you all now? Do you look down at me from wherever you are and chuckle as you watch me mulling over how our lives intersected? What should I make of all those incredible adventures we enjoyed together? What do you beautiful souls think of the nostalgia now welling up within me? Am I resurrecting moments from yesterday simply because I want to dust them off and discard them or because I want to burnish them more brightly and hold on to them more endearingly?<br><br> Baby licked my ear again and I came out of my reverie. I reminded myself that there weren&#x2019;t only movie stars in my past. There were politicians, judges, bankers, doctors, industrialists, newspaper columnists, even kings and queens. Not all were rich and famous. There were also plain, regular men and women whose names I shall never be able to recall. But I knew them all. Intimately.<br><br> I started the car and drove off. I realized that wherever I look, the suburbs, the boulevards, the side streets, the studios, the nightclubs, the fancy homes in the hills, there is a sliver of my past in all of it. There is so much to recall. There are apparitions and memories of myself everywhere. My mind lazily ambled through endless mental files containing images of glamorous parties, of wild poolside orgies, of weekends in fancy hotels, of studio dressing rooms, of crowded sound stages, of dark places where bodies collided with electrifying vigor, of ghostly gatherings of gorgeous women and virile young men, of a magnificent variety of passionate sex of every kind.<br><br> Frankly, I knew Hollywood like no one else knew it.<br></p><h2>The Story the Soldiers Wouldn&#39;t Tell: Sex in the Civil War</h2><p>First book to cover all aspects of sexuality during the Civil War. Based on area original sources, including the soldiers&#39; jokes, songs, letters, and diaries.</p><p>About thirty years ago I was reading Bill Wiley's immortal classic, <i>The Life of Johnny Reb.</i> On page 51 he asserted that a sexual history of the Civil War could never be written because of Victorian destruction of salacious material. I'm a contrarian. I began assembling material in a cardboard box. When the box weighed twenty-five pounds, I began to write. I liked the result. Thirty-five publishers did not. With guidance from William C. "Jack" Davis, Robert K. Krick, and Michael P. Musick the book emerged, vastly improved,&nbsp;and has since sold 32,000 copies.&nbsp; The facts, presented in a non-prurient way, seem to have&nbsp;amused many Civil War buffs. Later books, with even more facts and figures, had a lesser impact -- the taboo of mixing sex and the Civil War had already been lifted.Thomas P. Lowry, M.D. retired from medicine--he was a was a physician and psychiatrist for forty years--to write historical human interest stories like this one.</p><h2>The Terminator</h2><p>An unstoppable killer cyborg from the twenty-first century returns to 1984 Los Angeles to murder Sarah O&#39;Connor, and it is up to Reese, another visitor from the future to destroy The Terminator</p><p></p><h2>The Fasciae: Anatomy, Dysfunction and Treatment</h2><p>The fasciae comprise a wide variety of body tissues including the membranes, ligaments, tendons, and mesenteries. These tissues are all derived from the mesoderm, which undergoes coiling or rolling movements during embryonic development. This is the origin of the inherent micromovements, or motility, that are so important in many osteopathic approaches to diagnosis and treatment. The fasciae are found at every level of the body and constitute a basic element of human physiology. They serve as the body&#39;s first line of defense, acting independently of the central nervous system, which is why they are referred to as a peripheral brain. From a mechanical point of view, the fasciae are organized in chains to defend the body against restrictions. When a restriction goes beyond a specific threshold, the fasciae respond by modifying their viscoelasticity, changing the collagenic fibers, and transforming healthy fascial chains into lesional chains. The fasciae keep a record of every trauma that causes a change in motility. Through the sensitivity of trained hands, we are able to perceive movements on a microlevel and can thus detect motility disturbances, which reveal the medical history of a patient. Remedial techniques, adapted to each patient, can restore normal motility. In this way, fascial disturbances can be overcome, allowing the body to recover its normal physiological functions. For this reason, we can say that the health of every person is reflected in large part in the fasciae. The Fasciae: Anatomy, Dysfunction and Treatment is the first book to organize the wealth of available information concerning fascial tissues from the fields of embryology, anatomy, histology, and pathology. It describes the roles and mechanisms of the fasciae, and details appropriate testing and treatment techniques. The book is richly illustrated with color and black and white drawings.</p><p>Serge Paoletti, D.O. U.K. is a graduate of the European School of Osteopathy in Maidstone, England.

An Emmy-nominated screenwriter and a poet, she lives in Afton, Virginia.<b>Chapter 1<br></b><br> A bloodred cardinal sparkled against the snow-covered ground. He&#x2019;d dropped from his perch to snatch a few bits of millet still visible by the red chokeberry shrubs scattered at the edge of the field. The snow base, six inches, obscured most of the seeds that the flaming bird liked to eat, but light winds kept a few delicacies dropping, including some still-succulent chokeberry seeds.<br><br>Low gunmetal gray clouds, dense as fog in some spots, hung over the fresh white snow. In the center of this lovely thirty-acre hayfield on Orchard Hill Farm stood a lone sentinel, a 130-foot sugar maple. Surrounding the hayfield were forests of hardwoods and pine.<br><br>Two whitetail deer bolted over the three-board fence. Deer season ran from mid-November to January 2 in this part of Virginia. Those benighted humans who had yet to reach their legal bag limit might be found squatting in the snow on this December 27, a cold Saturday.<br><br>Bolting across the field in the direction opposite the deer came two sleek foxhounds. At first the cardinal, now joined by his mate, did not notice the hounds. The millet was too tasty. But when the birds heard the ruckus, they raised their crests and fluttered up to the oak branches as the hounds sped by.<br><br>Before the birds could drop back to their feast, four more hounds raced past, snow whirling up behind their paws like iridescent confetti.<br><br>In the distance, a hunting horn blew three long blasts, the signal for hounds to return.<br><br>Jane Arnold, Master of Foxhounds for the Jefferson Hunt Club, checked her advance just inside the forest at the westernmost border of the hayfield. The snowfall increased, huge flakes sticking to the horse&#x2019;s coat for a moment, to her eyelashes. She felt the cool, moist pat of flakes on her red cheeks. As she exhaled, a stream of breath also came from her mount, a lovely bold thoroughbred, Rickyroo.<br><br>Behind her, steam rising from their mounts&#x2019; hindquarters and flanks, were fifty-four riders. Ahead was the huntsman, Shaker Crown, a wiry man in his middle forties, again lifting the hunting horn to his lips. The bulk of the pack, twenty couple&#x2014;hounds are always counted in twos or couples&#x2014;obediently awaited their next order.<br><br>Sister cast her bright eyes over the treetops. Chickadees, wrens, and one woodpecker peered down at her. No foxes had just charged through here. Different birds had different responses to a predator like a fox. These creatures would have been disturbed, moved about. Crows, ravens, and starlings, on the other hand, would have lifted up in a flock and screamed bloody murder. They loathed being disturbed and despised foxes to the marrow of their light bones.<br><br>On Sister&#x2019;s left, a lone figure remained poised at the fence line. If Shaker moved forward, then the whipper-in, Betty Franklin, would take the old tiger trap jump and keep well to the left. Betty, a wise hunter, knew not to press on too far ahead. The splinter of the pack, which had broken now, veered to the right, and the second whipper-in, Sybil Hawkes, was already in pursuit well away across the hayfield.<br><br>Whether Sybil could turn the three couple of hounds troubled Sister. A pack should stay together&#x2014;easier said than done. Sister blamed herself for this incident. It takes years and years, decades really, to build a level pack of hounds. She had included too many first-year entry&#x2014;the hound equivalent of a first grader&#x2014;in to- day&#x2019;s hunt.<br><br>First-year entry sat in the kennels for Christmas Hunt, which had been last Saturday. Christmas Hunt, the third of the High Holy Days of hunting, overflows with people and excitement. Both she and her huntsman, whom Sister adored, felt the Christmas Hunt would have been too much for the youngsters. Today she should have taken only one couple, not the four included in this pack. Shaker had mentioned this to her, but she had waved him off, saying that the field wouldn&#x2019;t be that large today, as many riders would still be recuperating from the rigors of Christmas. There had been over one hundred people for Christmas Hunt, but she had half that today, still a good number of folks.<br><br>The hounds loved hunting in the snow. For the young entry this was their first big snow, and they just couldn&#x2019;t contain themselves.<br><br>She sat on Rickyroo who sensed her irritation. Sister felt a perfect ass. She&#x2019;d hunted all her life, and, at seventy-two, it was a full life. How could she now be so damned stupid?<br><br>Luckily, most people behind her knew little about the art of foxhunting, and it was an art not a science. They loved the pageantry, the danger, the running and jumping, its music. A few even loved the hounds themselves. Out of that field of fifty-four people, perhaps eight or nine really understood foxhunting. And that was fine by Sister. As long as people respected nature, pro- tected the environment, and paid homage to the fox&#x2014;a genius wrapped in fur&#x2014;she was happy. Foxhunting was like baseball: a person needn&#x2019;t know the difference between a sinker and a slider when it crossed home plate in order to enjoy the game. So long as people knew the basics and behaved themselves on horseback, she was pleased. She knew better than to expect anyone to behave when off a horse.<br><br>She observed Shaker. Every sense that man possessed was working overtime, as were hers. She drew in a cold draught of air, hoping for a hint of information. She listened intently and could hear, a third of a mile off, the three couple of hounds speaking for all they were worth. Perhaps they hit a fresh line of scent. In this snow, the scent would have to be fresh, just laid from the fox&#x2019;s paws. The rest of the pack watched Shaker. If scent were burning, surely Cora or Diana, Dasher or Ardent would have told them. But then the youngsters had broken off back in the woods. Had the pack missed the line? With an anchor hound like the four-year-old Diana, now in her third season, this was unlikely. Young though she was, this particular hound was following in the paw prints of one of the greatest anchor hounds Sister had ever known, Archie, gone to his reward and remembered with love every single day.<br><br>Odd how talent appears in certain hounds, horses, and humans. Diana definitely had it. She now faced the sound of the splinter group, stern level, head lifted, nose in the air. Something was up.<br><br>Behind Sister, Dr. Walter Lungrun gratefully caught his breath. The run up to this point had been longer than he realized, and he needed a break. Wealthy Crawford Howard, convivial as well as scheming, passed his flask around. It was accepted with broad smiles from friend and foe alike. Crawford subscribed to the policy that a man should keep his friends close and his enemies closer still. His wife, Marty, an attractive and intelligent woman, also passed around her flask. Crawford&#x2019;s potion was a mixture of blended scotch, Cointreau, a dash of bitters, with a few drops of fresh lemon juice. Liberally consumed, it hit like a sledgehammer.<br><br>Tedi and Edward Bancroft, impeccably turned out and true foxhunters, both in their seventh decade, listened keenly. Their daughter, Sybil, in her midforties, was the second whipper-in. She had her work cut out for her. They knew she was a bold rider, so they had no worries there. But Sybil, in her second year as an honorary whipper-in (as opposed to a professional) fretted over every mistake. Sybil&#x2019;s parents and two sons would buoy her up after each hunt since she was terribly hard on herself.<br><br>Betty Franklin loved whipping-in, but she knew there were moments when Great God Almighty couldn&#x2019;t control a hound with a notion. She was considerably more relaxed about her duties than Sybil.<br><br>Also passing around handblown glass flasks, silver caps engraved with their initials, were Henry Xavier (called Xavier or X), Clay Berry, and Ronnie Haslip&#x2014;men in their middle forties. These high-spirited fellows had been childhood friends of Ray Arnold Jr. Sister&#x2019;s son, born in 1960, had been killed in 1974 in a harvesting accident. The boys had been close, the Four Musketeers.<br><br>Sister had watched her son&#x2019;s best friends grow up, graduate from college. Two had married, all succeeded in business. They were very dear to her.<br><br>After about five minutes, Shaker tapped his hat with his horn, leaned down, and spoke encouragingly to Cora, his strike hound. She rose up on her hind legs to get closer to this man she worshipped. Then he said, &#x201c;Come long,&#x201d; and his pack obediently followed as he rode out of the forest, taking the second tiger trap jump as Betty Franklin took the first. If the pack and the huntsman were a clock, the strike hound being at twelve, Betty stayed at ten o&#x2019;clock, Sybil at two, the huntsman at six.<br><br>Sister, thirty yards behind Shaker, sailed over the tiger trap. Most of the other riders easily followed, but a few horses balked at the sight of the upright logs, leaning together just like a trap. The snow didn&#x2019;t help the nervous; resting along the crevices, it created an obstacle that appeared new and different.<br><br>As riders passed the sugar maple, Cora began waving her stern. The other hounds became interested.<br><br>Dragon, a hotheaded but talented third-year hound and the brother to Diana, bellowed, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s her! It&#x2019;s her!&#x201d;<br><br>The thick odor of a vixen lifted off the snow.<br><br>Cora, older, and steady even though she was the strike hound, paused a moment. &#x201c;Yes, it is a vixen, but something&#x2019;s not quite right.&#x201d;<br><br>Diana, her older brother, Dasher, and Asa and Ardent also paused. At nine, the oldest hound in the pack, Delia, mother of the D litters, usually brought up the rear. While her youthful speed had diminished, her knowledge was invaluable.

By the time the film opened on December 15, 1939, the anticipation and excitement were so great that the city of Atlanta declared the day an official holiday. Since then, more than 300 million people have seen the film and every year hundreds of thousands of copies of the novel are sold in dozens of languages.</p><p>This lavishly illustrated book is the ultimate behind-the-scenes history of the novel, the film, and the phenomenon of <i>Gone With the Wind.</i> It includes wonderful anecdotes, original quotes from the stars and the directors souvenir programs from the original premiere, many rare never-before published photographs, and more, from the smell of the smoke and the heat of the flames during the filming of the "burning of Atlanta" sequence to the soft touch of the red dust at the location Tara; from the fangue on the faces of cast and crew after grueling months of shooting to the thrill of premiere night, you will experience the unfolding drama as if you were there.</p><p></p></p><p><b>Herb Bridges</b> is the world's leading authority on <i>Gone With the Wind</i> and has amassed the world's largest collection of <i>GWTW</i> memorabilia.

The first printing sold out almost as fast as it rolled off the presses. Eager fans thronged around its author each time she set foot on a city street, as if she were a movie star, while the press beat a path to her door and never left it. <i>GWTW</i> had arrived. </p><p> Now, more than fifty years later, it is still popular. Readers are just as apt now, as then, to discover it sold out in bookstores and already checked out in libraries. </p><p> What was the mind behind <i>Gone With the Wind?</i> How was a work of such enduring popularity created? To know that, one must know its author, Margaret Mitchell. And to know her, one must slip back in time. </p><p> Atlanta, Georgia, 1900. The War Between the States had been waged and lost only thirty-five years earlier and was still a fresh and vivid memory. In the gracious homes that lined Peachtree Street and the shanties along Decatur Street still lived the survivors of a conflict that had already taken permanent root in the collective consciousness of the South and flourished. </p><p> Margaret Munnerlyn Mitchell was born on November 8 of that year, the fifth generation of her family to proudly call themselves Atlantans, steeped in the legends of the city and the South. </p><p> As a child she spent long, lazy Sunday afternoons "sitting on the bony knees of Confederate veterans and the fat, slick laps of old ladies who had survived the war," listening to tales of relatives who walked fifty miles with their skulls cracked by Yankee bullets, stuffed wrapping paper beneath their corsets to keep warm during the blockade, and sat down to supper with Rebel leaders. And all these tales were told not as epic drama but as ordinary family happenings that could have occurred just yesterday. </p><p> When she was six, Margaret herself became a rebel, against going to school. On a blazing hot September day her mother drove her out along the road to Jonesboro, pointing out the ruins of great houses that had fallen during or because of the war, chimneys standing ghostly among the scattered leaves and creeping foliage of the encroaching woods. She also pointed out the proud homes that still stood, testimony to their owners' steely spirit. </p><p> She explained that all the people who had once lived in all the houses had believed they had wealth and beauty and good times that would never end. But their world did end. And it would happen again, Margaret's mother warned. And when it did, she had better be prepared. "...All that would be left after a world ended would be what you could do with your hands and what you had in your head," not the least of which was an education. Margaret went to school. </p><p> Margaret grew up with the twentieth century, a Jazz Age baby, sufficiently enlightened in the New Era of women's equality to set off for college with aspirations of becoming a neurologist or psychiatrist. During her first year, however, her mother died in the influenza epidemic of 1919, and she came home to keep house for her father and brother. </p><p> A freethinking flapper, "one of those short-haired, short-skirted, hard-boiled young women who preachers said would go to hell or be hanged before they were thirty," as she described herself, Margaret talked her way into, and succeeded admirably at, a position as a reporter for the <i>Atlanta Journal Sunday Magazine,</i> no mean feat in an age where the only newspapermen were men. </p><p> Margaret -- Peggy, her friends called her -- moved about in a modern world of moving pictures, speedy automobiles, electric iceboxes airplanes, and radios, but to her the Civil War was just as recent and probably more real. </p><p> She found herself in 1926, at the height of the Jazz Age, housebound with a broken ankle that developed into arthritis she began to write a novel about the Civil War. </p><p> She was first of all a voracious reader. Her husband, John Marsh, brought home armloads of library books every night to entertain her until one evening he announced that he had exhausted the supply; she had read every book in the library except the exact sciences. Dropping a sheaf of copy paper in her lap, he told her she now had no choice but to write her own book. </p><p> She didn't know why she chose the Civil War as her subject, she would later say; it was just always there in her background. </p><p> The first chapter she wrote was the final one, in which Rhett leaves Scarlett alone to think about him "tomorrow," and from there she wrote a chapter here and a chapter there, apparently in no particular sequence, but as the spirit moved her. As each chapter was completed, it was sealed into a manila envelope and stacked next to the typewriter. When the stack became two and the two became towers, the envelopes were squirreled away in varying spots in the three-room apartment -- some under the bed, some under the sofa, others in the pots-and-pans cupboard. </p><p> When friends visited, the typewriter and the current chapter were covered over with a large bath towel. Peggy didn't like people to know she was working on a book. And, anyway, she never planned to sell it; it was only for her own amusement. </p><p> Sometime in 1929, the novel was finished, all except for the opening chapter and two others. The stock market crashed, a black and ominous Depression fell over the world, and Margaret Mitchell went on about the business of being Mrs. Peggy Marsh. </p><p> She had written the book mostly during the three years she had spent laid up, sometimes bedridden, with her bad ankle, having been told by doctors that she might never walk again. She finished the book, her ankle thankfully healed, and as she put it, "When my foot got well, I stopped writing because walking seemed far more interesting." </p><p> Peggy had been engaged once, to a young man who was shortly thereafter killed in World War I, and married once before -- for a period of only months -- to a fellow emotionally unequipped for life with the headstrong Margaret. But now her ship had come in. </p><p> Being Mrs. Marsh was fun. Peggy and John lived in a small, dark apartment they affectionately called "The Dump" and used as a base for lively, intellectually stimulating dinner parties and evening entertainments. Life flowed on like Southern molasses, sometimes thick and grainy, crystallized with illnesses or the woes of friends, but always sweet. </p><p> Then, in the spring of 1935, life abruptly changed. </p><p> Lois Cole, one of the few intimates who knew Peggy had been writing a book, was working for the Macmillan Company, publishers, in New York. The firm had reasoned that Southern books by new authors were frequent sellers and decided to send senior editor Harold Latham on a tour of the South. Lois suggested that he stop and talk with Peggy Marsh. Mr. Latham followed through, calling on her at her home. </p><p> Mrs. Marsh, however, insisted that she was not an author, was not writing, had never written a book, and wasn't the least bit interested in being reviewed by any publisher. Mr. Latham packed his bags and prepared to leave Atlanta. </p><p> But first he attended a tea where Peggy introduced him to a young girl who did hope to make it big as an author. As she drove the girl and her friends home from the tea, another young lady in the car spilled the beans about Peggy writing a book. The first girl was amazed. She couldn't believe that Mrs. Marsh could write. She didn't seem the type. She took life much too lightly, the girl said, and was wasting her time trying to be a serious novelist. As Peggy put it later, the girl had said,</p></p><h2>Amazing Milk Book, The (Amazing Books)</h2><p>A non-fiction book for children</p><p>Linda Hendry is an award winning illustrator and author of over 60 books for children, including many Kids Can Craft books and the Pup and Hound series.

M. Kaye</h2><p>In the first volume of her autobiography, <i>The Sun in the Morning, </i>M.M. Kaye detailed the first eighteen years of her life in India and England and introduced readers to her love affair with India. She brought to life its people, scents, vibrant colors, and breathtaking landscapes. In the second volume, <i>Golden Afternoon, </i>she happily returned to her beloved India after years in a British boarding school. New to the glories of the Delhi social season, M.M. Kaye recounted her delightful exploits as a vivacious young woman in Raj society.<br><br>Now, in <i>Enchanted Evening, </i>M.M. Kaye is a young woman forced to leave her cherished home in India when her father takes a new post in china. Though at first disoriented by the unfamiliar customs and confusing protocol of her new surroundings, it is in China that she discovers the pleasures that come from independence. Coming into her own as a painter, Kaye first meets with artistic success in China and then moves to cramped quarters in London's South Kensington neighborhood, where she begins to flourish as a writer.<br><br>With vivid descriptions and the wisdom that comes with age, M.M. Kaye looks back on the years she spent as a young woman in a world as yet unmarked by World War II's devastation.<br></p><p>The third volume of M.M. Kaye's memoirs continues the story of her life in the engagingly chatty style that is familiar from <i>The Sun in the Morning</i> and <i>Golden Afternoon</i>. As this volume begins, Kaye is a young woman in her 20s, apprehensively en route to China in the spring of 1932. She would have preferred to remain in India, her childhood home (and the setting, many years later, for her bestselling novel <i>The Far Pavilions</i>), but her beloved father, who has been dismissed unfairly from the British colonial service, wants to retire in China. Kaye's account of the family's sojourn is colorful and often quite funny, but the mood darkens when they return to India for younger sister Bet's wedding and their father dies shortly thereafter. Kaye goes to England, planning to support herself as an illustrator, but stumbles instead into a career writing mysteries and children's books. The self-effacing author presents this turn of events as a simple stroke of luck, and devotes most of her text to amusing anecdotes and evocative descriptions of landscape, particularly after royalty payments enable her to return happily to India. In the privileged British Raj, politics hardly impinge until World War II begins in 1939, and this ill wind blows good toward our redoubtable heroine, who meets Mr. Right in the shape of an Indian Army officer who is escaping a bad marriage. Even here, Kaye is oh-so-English in her assertion that Lieutenant Godfrey John Hamilton was "only too ready to fall into the arms of almost any unattached woman.... I can only be profoundly and eternally grateful that she happened to be me." The warm humanism and ready wit that are displayed throughout these charming reminiscences will prompt most readers to feel that Lieutenant Hamilton was the lucky one. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>10 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The ABC Bible Verse Book</h2><p>With delightful illustrations, this fantastic book goes through the 26 Bible verses, one for each letter of the alphabet, giving children the opportunity to learn scripture while seeing them illustrated in a tangible way.

Not much more developed are the two leads&#x2014;Carey, the son of Anne Boleyn's sister, Mary, and thus cousin to Queen Elizabeth, and his sidekick, Sergeant Dodd, whose heavy dialect (whit can ye dae to show us ye're no' one o' his kinship come tae trap us in ambush?) can be tough to follow. Carey and Dodd seek legal representation to bring a case of unlawful imprisonment against the queen's vice chamberlain, look into the identity of an unclaimed corpse found in the Thames, and probe some shady land deals in Cornwall. Unfortunately, the multiple story lines fail to gel, and the plot drags for long stretches.

In early life he attended the University of Cincinnati and Hanover College, Indiana, before working as a newspaperman and magazine writer in the Midwest. His first foray into the mystery genre was The Fabulous Clipjoint (1947) which won the Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for outstanding first mystery novel. As an author he wrote more than thirty novels and over three hundred short stories, and is noted for a bold use of narrative experimentation, as exemplified in The Lenient Beast (1956) Many of his books employ the threat of the supernatural or occult before concluding with a logical explanation, and he is renowned for both original plots and ingenious endings. In the 1950s he moved to Tucson and wrote for television and film, continuing to submit many short stories that regularly appeared in mystery anthologies.

Rachel Carson's rare ability to combine scientific insight with moving, poetic prose catapaulted her book to first place on <em>The New York Times</em> best-seller list, where it ruled for thirty-one consecutive weeks. It remained on the list for more than a year and a half and ultimately sold well over a million copies, has been translated into 28 languages, inspired an Academy Award-winning documentary, and won both the 1952 National Book Award and the John Burroughs Medal. <br> This classic work remains as fresh today as when it first appeared. Carson's writing teems with stunning, memorable images--the newly formed Earth cooling in perpetual gloom beneath an endlessly overcast sky; the centuries of nonstop rain that created the oceans; giant squids battling sperm whales hundreds of fathoms below the surface; and incredibly powerful tides moving 100 billion tons of water daily in the Bay of Fundy. Carson describes the hidden mountains and canyons of the ocean deeps and how they are now being mapped; the ceaseless power of the winds, waves, and currents; the meaning of the ocean to humanity--the heritage of the sea that we carry in our bodies--and the riches to be found in every cubic mile of seawater ($93,000,000 in gold alone). In short, she captures the mystery and allure of the ocean with a compelling blend of imagination and expertise. <br> This Special Edition features a brand new chapter written by Jeffrey Levinton, a leading expert in marine ecology, who brings the scientific side of <em>The Sea Around Us</em> completely up to date. Levinton incorporates the most recent thinking on continental drift, coral reefs, the spread of the ocean floor, the deterioration of the oceans, mass extinction of sea life, and many other topics. In addition, acclaimed nature writer Anne Zwinger has contributed a brief foreword. <br> Today, with the oceans endangered by medical waste and ecological disasters such as the Exxon oil spill in Alaska, this illuminating volume provides a timely reminder of both the fragility and the importance of the ocean and the life that abounds within it. Anyone who loves the sea, or who is concerned about our natural environment, will want to read this classic work.</p><p><br><em>About the Author</em>:<br> The late <strong>Rachel Carson</strong> was for many years a marine biologist and then editor-in-chief of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. She is also the author of <em>Silent Spring</em>. <strong>Jeffrey Levinton</strong> teaches at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and is the author of <em>Marine Ecology</em>. <strong>Anne</strong> <strong>Zwinger</strong> is the author of <em>A Desert Country Near the Sea</em>, <em>Beyond the Aspen Grove</em>, and <em>Run, River, Run</em>.<br>Before the first living cell was created, there may have been many trials and failures. It seems probable that, within the warm saltiness of the primeval sea, certain organic substances were fashioned from carbon dioxide, sulphur, nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, and calcium. Perhaps these were transition steps from which the complex molecules of protoplasm arose-molecules that somehow acquired the ability to reproduce themselves and begin the endless stream of life. It is doubtful that the first life possessed the substance chlorophyll, with which plants in sunlight transform lifeless chemicals into the living stuff of their tissues. Little sunshine could enter their dim world, penetrating the cloud banks from which fell the endless rains. Probably the sea&#39;s first children lived on the organic substances then present in the ocean waters, or, like the iron and sulphur bacteria that exist today, lived directly on inorganic food.</p><h2>How to Expel Demons, Break Curses and Release Blessings</h2><p>New- Hardcover in Bonded Leather.

Unlike most in his profession who treat economic disasters as freakish once-in-�a-lifetime events without clear cause, Roubini, after decades of careful research around the world, realized that they were both probable and predictable. Armed with an unconventional blend of historical analysis and global economics, Roubini has forced politicians, policy makers, investors, and market watchers to face a long-neglected truth: financial systems are inherently fragile and prone to collapse. <br><br> Drawing on the parallels from many countries and centuries, Nouriel Roubini and Stephen Mihm, a professor of economic history and a <i>New York Times Magazine</i> writer, show that financial cataclysms are as old and as ubiquitous as capitalism itself. The last two decades alone have witnessed comparable crises in countries as diverse as Mexico, Thailand, Brazil, Pakistan, and Argentina. All of these crises-not to mention the more sweeping cataclysms such as the Great Depression-have much in common with the current downturn. Bringing lessons of earlier episodes to bear on our present predicament, Roubini and Mihm show how we can recognize and grapple with the inherent instability of the global financial system, understand its pressure points, learn from previous episodes of "irrational exuberance," pinpoint the course of global contagion, and plan for our immediate future. Perhaps most important, the authors-considering theories, statistics, and mathematical models with the skepticism that recent history warrants&#x2014;explain how the world's economy can get out of the mess we're in, and stay out. <br><br> In Roubini's shadow, economists and investors are increasingly realizing that they can no longer afford to consider crises the black swans of financial history. A vital and timeless book, <i>Crisis Economics</i> proves calamities to be not only predictable but also preventable and, with the right medicine, curable.</p><p><strong>Ian Bremmer and Nouriel Roubini: Author One-to-One</strong> <br> In this Amazon exclusive, we brought together authors Ian Bremmer and Nouriel Roubini and asked them to interview each other. <br> <br> <strong>Ian Bremmer</strong> is the president of Eurasia Group, the world's leading global political risk research and consulting firm. He has written for <em>The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, Newsweek, Foreign Affairs</em>, and other publications, and his books include <em>The End of the Free Market</em>, <em>The J Curve</em>, and <em>The Fat Tail</em>. Read on to see Ian Bremmer's questions for Nouriel Roubini, or turn the tables to see what Roubini asked Bremmer. <br> <br> <strong>Bremmer</strong>: You argue in your book [<em>Crisis Economics: A Crash Course in the Future of Finance</em>] that financial crises are not unpredictable &#x201c;black swan&#x201d; events but, rather, can be forecast &#x2013; in effect, white swans. What do you mean by that? <br> <br> <strong>Roubini</strong>: My friend Nassim Taleb popularized the concept of &#x201c;Black Swans,&#x201d; those economic and financial events that are sudden, unexpected and unpredictable. But if you look at financial crises through history &#x2013; and the earliest is the Tulipmania in the Netherlands in the 17th Century &#x2013; you see a pattern that is highly regular and predictable: An asset bubble &#x2013; often in real estate or in stock markets or in a new industry &#x2013; leads to financial euphoria, excessive risk taking, an accumulation of excessive debt and leverage. So the signposts of this phase &#x2014; asset boom and bubble, followed by the eventual bust and crash &#x2014; are highly predictable if one looks at the economic and financial indicators that show the build-up of such excesses. Thus, financial boom and bust are predictable white swan events, not unpredictable and random black swans. Financial crises have repeatedly occurred for hundreds of years and they follow quite regular pattern. That is why my book is about &#x201c;crisis economics&#x201d;, a phenomenon that is becoming more of a rule than an exception. Financial crises that should have occurred once in 100 years now occur more frequently and with greater virulence than in the past; and their economic, fiscal, financial and social costs are rising. <br> <br> The trouble is that in the bubble phase nearly everyone, the exception being a few critical analysts, is swept in a delusional bubble mania of irrational euphoria: households, financial institutions, investors, governments, spinmeisters all of whom profit from the bubble, including Ponzi-schemers who concoct their houses of cards and financial con games. So, in each bubble there are cranks who argue that this time is different and that the bubble is driven by a fundamental brave new world of ever rising growth and profits. Then, when the boom and bubble turns into a bust and crash, a reality check occurs and financial depression sets in. <br> <br> <strong>Bremmer</strong>: Who is to blame the most for the recent financial crisis? Who were the culprits of the latest one? <br> <br> <strong>Roubini</strong>: The list of culprits is very long. The Fed kept interest rates too low for too long in the earlier part the past decade and fed &#x2014; pun intended &#x2014; the housing and credit bubble. Bankers and investors on Wall Street and in financial institutions were greedy, arrogant and reckless in their risk taking and build-up of leverage because they were compensated based on short term profits. As a result, they generated toxic loans &#x2013; subprime mortgages and other mortgages and loans &#x2013; that borrowers could not afford and then packaged these mortgages and loans into toxic securities &#x2013; the entire alphabet soup of structured finance products, so-called &#x201c;SIVs&#x201d; like MBSs &#x2013; Mortgage-Backed Securities, or CDOs &#x2013; Collateralized Debt Obligations -- and even CDOs of CDOs. These were new, complex, exotic, non-transparent, non-traded, marked-to-model rather than market-to-market and mis-rated by the rating agencies. Indeed, the rating agencies were also culprits as they had massive conflicts of interest: they made most of their profits from mis-rating these new instruments and being paid handsomely by the issuers. Also, the regulators and supervisors were asleep at the wheel as the ideology in Washington for the last decade was one of laissez faire &#x201c;Wild West&#x201d; capitalism with little prudential regulation and supervision of banks and other financial institutions. <br> <br> <strong>Bremmer</strong>: In the book you express concern that following the massive leveraging of the private sector there is now a massive re-leveraging of the public sector that will put the economic recovery at risk. Why such worries? <br> <br> <strong>Roubini</strong>: The Great Recession of 2008-2009 was triggered by excessive debt accumulation and leverage on the part of households, financial institutions and even the corporate sector in many advanced economies. While there is much talk about de-leveraging as the crisis wanes, the reality is that private-sector debt ratios have stabilized at very high levels. By contrast, as a consequence of fiscal stimulus and socialization of part of the private sector&#x2019;s losses, there is now a massive re-leveraging of the public sector. Deficits in excess of 10% of GDP can be found in many advanced economies, including America&#x2019;s, and debt-to-GDP ratios are expected to rise sharply &#x2013; in some cases doubling in the next few years. <br> <br> Such balance-sheet crises have historically led to economic recoveries that are slow, anemic, and below-trend for many years. Sovereign-debt problems are another strong possibility, given the massive re-leveraging of the public sector. In countries that cannot issue debt in their own currency (traditionally emerging-market economies), or that issue debt in their own currency but cannot independently print money (as in the eurozone), unsustainable fiscal deficits often lead to a credit crisis, a sovereign default, or other coercive form of public-debt restructuring. In countries that borrow in their own currency and can monetize the public debt, a sovereign debt crisis is unlikely, but monetization of fiscal deficits can eventually lead to high inflation. And inflation is &#x2013; like default &#x2013; a capital levy on holders of public debt, as it reduces the real value of nominal liabilities at fixed interest rates. <br> <br> Thus, the recent problems faced by Greece are only the tip of a sovereign-debt iceberg in many advanced economies (and a smaller number of emerging markets). Bond-market vigilantes already have taken aim at Greece, Spain, Portugal, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Iceland, pushing government bond yields higher. Eventually they may take aim at other countries &#x2013; even Japan and the United States &#x2013; where fiscal policy is on an unsustainable path. <br> <br> <strong>Bremmer</strong>: Should we then worry about the risk of a collapse of the European Monetary Union--the so-called &#x201c;eurozone?&#x201d; <br> <br> <strong>Roubini</strong>: This is a serious and rising risk. The dilemma for Greece and the other fiscally challenge countries dubbed the PIIGS &#x2014; that&#x2019;s Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, Spain &#x2014; is that, whereas fiscal consolidation is necessary to prevent an unsustainable increase in the spread on sovereign bonds, the short-run effects of raising taxes and cutting government spending tend to cause economic contraction. This, too, complicates the public-debt dynamics and impedes the restoration of public-debt sustainability. Indeed, this was the trap faced by Argentina in 1998-2001, when needed fiscal contraction exacerbated recession and eventually led to default. <br> <br> In countries like the eurozone members, a loss of external competitiveness, caused by tight monetary policy and a strong currency, erosion of long-term comparative advantage relative to emerging markets, and wage growth in excess of productivity growth, impose further constraints on the resumption of growth. If growth does not recover, the fiscal problems will worsen while making it more politically difficult to enact the painful reforms needed to restore competitiveness. <br> <br> A vicious circle of public-finance deficits, current-account gaps, worsening external-debt dynamics, and stagnating growth can then set in. Eventually, this can lead to default on euro-zone members&#x2019; public and foreign debt, as well as exit from the monetary union by fragile economies unable to adjust and reform fast enough. <br> <br> Provision of liquidity by an international lender of last resort &#x2013; the European Central Bank, the IMF, or even a new European Monetary Fund &#x2013; could prevent an illiquidity problem from turning into an insolvency problem. But if a country is effectively insolvent rather than just illiquid, such &#x201c;bailouts&#x201d; cannot prevent eventual default and devaluation (or exit from a monetary union) because the international lender of last resort eventually will stop financing an unsustainable debt dynamic, as occurred Argentina (and in Russia in 1998). Thus, the weakest links of the EMU &#x2013; countries such as Greece may be eventually be forced to default and to exit the monetary union to regain their competitiveness and growth through a depreciation of their new national currency. <br> <br> <strong>Bremmer</strong>: So how can we properly deal with the fallout of financial crises? How to properly reduce private and public debts? <br> <br> <strong>Roubini</strong>: Cleaning up high private-sector debt and lowering public-debt ratios by growth alone is particularly hard if a balance-sheet crisis leads to an anemic recovery. And reducing debt ratios by saving more leads to the paradox of thrift: too fast an increase in savings deepens the recession and makes debt ratios even worse. <br> <br> At the end of the day, resolving private-sector leverage problems by fully socializing private losses and re-leveraging the public sector is risky. At best, taxes will eventually be raised and spending cut, with a negative effect on growth; at worst, the outcome may be direct capital levies (default) or indirect ones (the inflation tax if large budget deficits are sharply monetized). <br> <br> Unsustainable private-debt problems must be resolved by defaults, debt reductions, and conversion of debt into equity. If, instead, private debts are excessively socialized, the advanced economies will face a grim future: serious sustainability problems with their public, private, and foreign debt, together with crippled prospects for economic growth. <br> <br> <strong>Bremmer</strong>: In the book you propose radical reforms of the system of regulation and supervision of banks and other financial institutions and criticize the more cosmetic reforms now considered by the US Congress and in other countries. Why the need for radical reform? <br> <br> <strong>Roubini</strong>: If reforms will be cosmetic we will not prevent future asset and credit bubbles and we will experience new and more virulent crises. The currently proposed reforms of &#x201c;too-big-to-fail&#x201d; financial institutions are not sufficient: imposing higher capital levies on these firms and have a resolution regime for an orderly shutdown of large systemically important insolvent firms will not work. If a financial firm is too-big-to-fail it is just too big: it should be broken up to make it less systemically important. And in the heat of the next crisis using a resolution regime to close down too-big-to-fail firms will be very hard; thus, the temptation to bail them out again will be dominant. <br> <br> Also, the modest Volcker Rule &#x2013; that may not even be passed by Congress because of the banking lobbies power &#x2013; does not go far enough. It correctly points out that banking institutions that have access to insured deposits and to the lender of last resort support of the Fed should not be allowed to engage into risky activities such as prop trading, hedge funds and private investments. But more needs to be done: we need to go back to the more radical separation between commercial and investment banking that the Glass Steagall Act had imposed. Repealing this Act was a mistake that led to excessive risk taking and leverage by both banks and non-bank financial institutions. <br> <br> Finally, the government should regulate much more tightly toxic and dangerous over-the-counter derivative instruments; and compensation of bankers and traders should be subject to radical &#x201c;clawbacks&#x201d;: bonuses should not be paid outright but go into a fund and clawed back if the initial investments/trades turned out to be risky and money losing over time. <br> <br> <strong>Bremmer</strong>: Have we learned the lessons from the last financial crisis or are we planting the seeds of the next one? <br> <br> <strong>Roubini</strong>: I fear that we have not learned those lessons and that part of the policy response is now creating a new global asset bubble that will cause a bigger financial crisis in the next few years. For one thing, there is a lot of talk about better regulation an supervision of the financial system but the financial industry is back to business as usual &#x2013; rebuilding leverage, engaging in prop trading and other risk behavior, compensating bankers and traders with indecent bonuses - and is lobbying against better regulation and supervision. Governments are talking about reforms but almost no one has implemented them. <br> <br> In the meanwhile interest rates remain close to zero in most advanced economies and they are also very low in many overheating emerging markets. Also dollar funded carry trades are feeding asset bubbles globally. Thus, part of the sharp rise in risky asset prices since March 2009 is driven by a wall of liquidity chasing assets that are becoming overpriced: US and global equities, credit, oil and commodity prices, emerging markets asset prices. And if this bubble eventually gets out of hand the eventual bust could lead to another and bigger global financial crisis in the next two or three years. <br> <br> (Photo of Nouriel Roubini � RGE Monitor)Nouriel Roubini is a professor of economics at New York University&#x2019;s Stern School of Business.

In the mid-17th century, the Count of Nassau set about the restoration of his castle at Idstein near Frankfurt, including the creation of a garden of rare plants and flowers. So pleased was he with his new garden that he commissioned Johann Walther, an artist famed for his skill as a miniaturist and painter of natural forms, to make a record of the garden and all its species. The result is a breathtaking collection of flowers of the period--lilies, roses, fritillaries, hollyhocks, aquilegias, and anemones among them. Accompanying the paintings are engravings from some of the great botanical artists, snippets from gardening calendars and handbooks, a selection of poems and quotations, as well as the history of each flower and the folklore surrounding it. A book that will not fail to charm garden enthusiasts and all who appreciate botanical art. 104 pp 8 x 9 44 color &amp; 7 b/w illustrations</p><p></p><h2>George&#39;s Marvelous Medicine</h2><p>George is alone in the house with Grandma.

According to the traditional telling, the American Revolution began with "the shot heard round the world." Ray Raphael's <i>The First American Revolution</i> uses the wide-angle lens of a people's historian to tell a surprising new story of America's revolutionary struggle. In the years before the battle of Lexington and Concord, local peoplemen and women of common means but of uncommon courageoverturned British authority and declared themselves free from colonial oppression, with acts of rebellion that long predated the Boston Tea Party. In rural towns such as Worcester, Massachusetts, democracy set down roots well before the Boston patriots made their moves in the fight for independence. Richly documented, <i>The First American Revolution</i> recaptures in vivid detail the grassroots activism that drove events in the years leading up to the break from Britain.</p><p><b>Ray Raphael</b> is the author of numerous books, including <i>A People's History of the American Revolution; An Everyday History of Somewhere; Men From the Boys</i>; and <i>Tree Talk</i>. He lives in northern California.Historian Raphael contends that the United States' war for independence did not begin in April 1775 with the "shot heard round the world." Rather it began the previous summer in rural towns like Worcester as patriots forced royal appointees to publicly resign their offices. These actions brought to a standstill the courts and public bodies established under the Massachusetts Government Act. The thousands of farmers and artisans then reclaimed the Charter of 1691 to democratically reopen the courts, establish new governmental bodies and organize a network of militias. Raphael thus brings into clear focus events and identities of ordinary people who should share the historic limelight with the Founding Fathers. This successful rebellion has until now remained obscure, the author says, because "[t]he telling of history cries out for individual protagonists" while this revolution was decentralized and nonhierarchical, creating not leaders but a participatory democracy that, in Raphael's view, "far outreached the intentions of the so-called `Founding Fathers.'" Moreover, unlike Lexington and Concord, this revolution involved no dramatic shedding of blood. Whether or not "the transfer of political authority to the American patriots" in 1774 was the "real revolution" making the clash in April 1775 a British counter-revolution to regain lost territory Raphael (A People's History of the American Revolution) makes a compelling case that these early events were critical to the success of the war that followed and should no longer escape our notice.

"ALL this hammering away on a hot computer keyboard.""Productive hammering, my love," I said, pushing away my own keyboard, yawning and stretching until my joints cracked. "In a little under two hours we have made more than two hundred thousand credits through insider dealing in the stock exchange. Some might believe it illegal--but very profitable. I prefer to see it as a public service. To keep the money circulating, to lower the level of unemployment ...""Not now, Jim. I am too tired to listen.""But not too tired to listen to this. Right now we need a complete change. What do you say to a picnic in a leafy dell in Sharwood Forest? With champagne.""A lovely idea, but the shopping ...""Has been already done. I have a complete picnic, basket and all, in the stasis freezer. Everything from caviar to Roc's eggs. We have but to sling it into the hoverfloat, along with plenty of bubbly drink, and let joy begin."And so it did. While Angelina slipped into something picnicky, I slipped the picnic hamper into the hoverfloat--humming happily as I did so for we had been working too hard of late. We must escape the daily grind. A change of scenery. Inthe nearby forest, which was one of the few green spots on the painfully boring planet of Usti nad Labam. The landscape was all dark satanic techno-factories run by computer nerds. It was a pleasure to rob them. Using the most advanced hacking techniques I had slipped some software into the operating system of a prominent broker. With this I could slow their input of information by varying lengths of time. With this advance knowledge I could buy before a price rise--then sell at the higher price. Neat.A favor to them really, because when the scam was eventually discovered, I truly believe that the resultant news stories and jolly police chases would give them something to think about for a change. Instead of the incessant RAM, ROM, PROM. In our own way Angelina and I were benefactors, bringing joy into otherwise boring lives. The price was a small one for them. Infinitesimal. Angelina joined me and we were up, up and away.The engine roared forcefully, the air rushed by swiftly, and we held hands compassionately as our transport of delight soared skyward."Wonderful," Angelina breathed.<i>"Merda,"</i> I growled as a police warning bleeped and blinked on the console. There it was--a police cruiser swooping towards us. I stamped hard on the power."Please don't," Angelina said, placing a gentle hand on my arm. "Let us not spoil the day with a sizzling chase. Could we just stop, smile at the police? Not you, me. All you have to do is pay the fine. I will charm the police, you pay their fine, and we will then go on."It made sense. There was no point in spoiling our day out before it really started. I sighed dramatically and, with great reluctance, eased off.Our speed dropped.The police cruiser fired its nose guns at us.Things happened very quickly after that.I hit overdrive and pulled back hard into an inside loop.The police missed: I didn't. I blew the cruiser's tail off. Then I banked hard to avoid the hosing slugs from his wingman. As the police vehicle swooped by I saw that it had no windows. Therefore no occupants."Robot policemen!" I chortled. "Therefore we don't have to hold back and spare their lives. Because they have no lives! To the junkyard with the lot!"After that it was Old Home Week in the diGriz partnership. I climbed--then did a 5G dive to get away from the flock of police cruisers that had appeared all too suddenly. Hit the reverse drive when they were all on my tail. Angelina worked the armament and defenses as they zipped by and managed to get three of them. Even on the most peaceful planet I go not unarmed into the sky; our peaceful hoverfloat was a lot more deadly than it looked.But this chase was beginning to turn nasty. We were vastly outnumbered and outgunned. "And running out of ammo," Angelina said, echoing my own thoughts."Change of venue!" I shouted, dropping towards the green forest below. "Grab the survival kit and get ready for a bumpy landing."I screeched low over a rock-tipped ridge, dived into the valley beyond--and braked to a hover under the trees below. Angelina had the door open as we juddered to a stop, the kit thrown out, and was diving right out behind it when I hit the two-second-delay button. I was cutting it a little too close: the doorframe hit my bootheel as I went out. I changed the dive into a roll, hit the ground hard on my shoulders and thudded to a stop, all of the air knocked out of me."My hero," my dear wife said, patting my eheek and kissing my forehead. "Now let's move it."We did. Grabbing up the kit, she gracefully, and I haltingly, dived into the protection of the shrubbery.Meanwhile above the trees the battle roared as our faithful hoverfloat defended itself with all the robotic skill at its command. Alas, the fracas ended suddenly with a tremendous explosion."End of champagne and caviar," Angelina said, her voice so cold I felt my body temperature drop."I'll not contribute to the Policeman's Ball this year." I grimaced.She laughed warmly and squeezed my hand. And the old, cold deadly Angelina slipped away."Let's make tracks," I said. "Before they discover that they were fighting the robot pilot.""Let us not," she said. "This is a nice big tree that we are under. It will shield us from visual observation, perhaps infrared imaging as well. If they suspect that we were not in the hoverfloat they could backtrack and look for us.""Your logic is impeccable," I said, rooting through the survival kit. Guns, grenades, all the necessities of life. "And to carry that logic a bit further--why were the police trying to shoot us up?""I haven't the foggiest. As far as the authorities know we are simple tourists who dabble in the market. Sometimes losing ...""Most times winning!""What do you have there?" she asked as I pulled a silver form out from behind a belt of ammunition."Jolly Barman Instant Cocktails. I bought a couple of these on sale." I pulled the tab and two plastic beakers dropped into my hand. There was a hissing sound and the can turned cold in my hand; moisture condensed on it. I handed Angelina a beaker, poured it full of sparkling liquid. The gray scraps in the bottoms of the mugs were instantly reconstituted by the liquid to pieces of fruit. I poured another drink for myself and we sipped appreciatively."Not too bad." I smacked my lips and cudgeled my brain. "Those police were out to blast us--not arrest us. Are we missing something?""Obviously. I think that we should get out of the forest now and see what we can find out about this mystery attack.""We can't exactly call the police and ask them why they were gunning for us--can we?""We can't. Therefore I will think of something more subtle. Call our son James and have him do a computer search of our problem. After at!--he is in the computer business here and should know how to get information.""An excellent idea. We can also have him come pick us up since it is a long walk home."We finished the drinks and I shouldered the survival kit. There was no sound of aircraft now, just some distant birdcalls and the hum of insects. We moved through the trees, staying undercover, distancing ourselves from the action with the police fleet. We listened closely but there was no sound of any engines behind or above us. I smiled. Then I frowned when I heard the grumble of a motor up ahead."Perhaps that is a sturdy forester, practicing his weald-wise trade," I said hopefully."Would that it were. Because whatever it is out there is coming closer. If they are looking for us, then I am forced to believe that all of this activity and attention is far too murderous for a simple traffic bust.""Unhappily, I agree. They have made no attempt to communicate with us--just came in blasting."I looked on gloomily as she opened the survival kit and took out an immense handgun. "But let us not make it easy for them."We didn't. The armored police cruiser had its tracks blow off as it appeared. It kept firing at us even though it couldn't move. We dived in close, so close it could not depress its guns to get at us. I jumped to the top of the tread, flipped open the top hatch and dropped a couple of sleep capsules. Then I looked carefully inside."Highly interesting." I rejoined Angelina on the ground. "Nobody home. Which means, like the cruisers that chased us, this thing is also robot operated and remotely controlled.""By whom?""By our new enemies, whoever they are."Distant engines sounded from behind the trees and we slipped away in the opposite direction, deeper into the forest. Which did not do much good in the end because there were now sounds of machines from ahead."They have trackers on us--so there is no point in wearying ourselves by running about. We'll stay here and make a stand. Get as many of these robot machines as we can.""I thought that there were laws of robotics--about not killing or injuring humans.""It looks like those laws were repealed. Lock and load--here they come again!"I would have felt a certain compunction about killing a policeman, but I really did enjoy blasting police robots into tiny bits of junk. But it proved to be a no-win battle. Wherever we turned they were there ahead of us. Our ammunition dwindled as their numbers increased."My last grenade," Angelina said as she blasted a hovertank."My last shot," I said, taking out a robocycle. "It has been nice knowing you.""Nonsense, Jim.

They were created over the first seven decades of the 19th century and were described by a critic in 1855 as &#34;the most faithful image of our epoch&#34;. The book brings together a wide range of original-source materials, including letters, critical reviews, biographical documents and photographs. The major portraits are discussed and reproduced, and more than 100 portrait drawings and many preparatory studies are also included.</p><p>This catalog of the portraits of the 19th-century painter Ingres is a companion volume to the traveling exhibition sponsored by the National Gallery in London, the National Gallery in Washington, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. In the first major study on this subject, five scholars chart the chronology of Ingres the portraitist and seek to place this aspect of his oeuvre within the context of his career and, more broadly, within 19th-century European society and the history of portraiture. Chief influences in the portraits of Ingres include the classical tradition of his teacher, David and that of Renaissance artist, Raphael. Beautiful color and black-and-white reproductions illustrate both Ingres's oil paintings and graphite drawings.

After graduating with a BA from Columbia University, he worked for several years in Paris before pursuing his graduate studies in history at The Johns Hopkins University, where he earned his Ph.D. in 2003. He was a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow in U.S. history at Cambridge University, England, for one year, after which he moved to Montreal, Canada, where he is an assistant professor of history at the Universit de Montral.Furstenberg presents two works in one in this well-written and researched work. Examining the ideas that formed the American mindset and framed its outlook in the early decades of our republic, we see how George Washington came to be known as "The Father of His Country" and how slavery was both justified and condemned. As the author analyzes Washington's "Farewell Address" and continues with other numerous documents and objects of popular culture, we see how our "sacred scripture" was formed. Michael Prichard has the voice we wish all of our professors had. He reads with an almost patrician confidence and the authority of someone who is intimately acquainted with his subject. His resonant voice leaves us wanting more.

Grace came to serve in the house as a girl. She left as a young woman, after the presumed suicide of a famous young poet at the property's lake. Though she has dutifully kept the family's secrets for decades, memories flood back in the twilight of her life when a young filmmaker comes calling with questions about how the poet really died--and why the Ashbury sisters never again spoke to each other afterward. With beautifully crafted prose, Morton methodically reveals how passion and fate transpired that night at the lake, with truly shocking results. Her final revelation at the story's close packs a satisfying (and not overly sentimental) emotional punch. <i>--Mari Malcolm</i><b>Kate Morton</b>, a native Australian, holds degrees in dramatic art and English literature and is currently a doctoral candidate at the University of Queensland.

Think of it as tough love . . . for yourself.<br><br>Whether an artist, writer or business person, this simple, personal, and no-nonsense book will inspire you to seize the potential of your life. <br><br></p><p>From the Introduction<br> Robert McKee<br> Bestselling Author of <i>STORY: Substance, Structure, Style, and the Principles of Screenwriting</i><br> On <i>The War of Art</i><br> Steven Pressfield wrote <i>The War of Art</i> for me. He undoubtedly wrote it for you too, but I know he did it expressly for me because I hold Olympic records for procrastination. I can procrastinate thinking about my procrastination problem. I can procrastinate dealing with my problem of procrastinating thinking about my procrastination problem. So Pressfield, that devil, asked me to write this foreword <i>against a deadline</i>, knowing that no matter how much I stalled, eventually I'd have to knuckle down and do the work. At the last possible hour I did, and as I leafed through Book One, "Defining the Enemy," I saw myself staring back guilty-eyed from every page. But then Book Two gave me a battle plan; Book Three, a vision of victory; and as I closed <i>The War of Art</i>, I felt a surge of positive calm. I now know I can win this war. And if I can, so can you.<p> To begin Book One, Pressfield labels the enemy of creativity Resistance, his all-encompassing term for what Freud called the Death Wish-that destructive force inside human nature that rises whenever we consider a tough, long-term course of action that might do for us or others something that's actually good. He then presents a rogue's gallery of the many manifestations of Resistance. You will recognize each and every one, for this force lives within us all-self-sabotage, self-deception, self-corruption. We writers know it as "block," a paralysis whose symptoms can bring on appalling behavior.</p><p> Some years ago I was as blocked as a Calcutta sewer, so what did I do? I decided to try on all my clothes. To show just how anal I can get, I put on every shirt, pair of pants, sweater, jacket, and sock, sorting them into piles: spring, summer, fall, winter, Salvation Army. Then I tried them on all over again, this time parsing them into spring casual, spring formal, summer casual... Two days of this and I thought I was going mad. Want to know how to cure writer's block? It's not a trip to your psychiatrist. For as Pressfield wisely points out, seeking "support" is Resistance at its most seductive. No, the cure is found in Book Two: "Turning Pro."</p><p> Steven Pressfield is the very definition of a pro. I know this because I can't count the times I called the author of <i>The Legend of Bagger Vance</i> to invite him for a round of golf, and although tempted, he declined. Why? Because he was working, and as any writer who has ever taken a backswing knows, golf is a beautifully virulent form of procrastination. In other words, Resistance. Steve packs a discipline forged of Bethlehem steel.</p><p> I read Steve's <i>Gates of Fire</i> and <i>Tides of War</i> back-to-back while traveling in Europe. Now, I'm not a lachrymose guy; I hadn't cried over a book since <i>The Red Pony</i>, but these novels got to me. I found myself sitting in caf�s, choking back tears over the selfless courage of those Greeks who shaped and saved Western civilization. As I looked beneath his seamless prose and sensed his depth of research, of knowledge of human nature and society, of vividly imagined telling details, I was in awe of the work, the work, all the work that built the foundation of his riveting creations. And I'm not alone in this appreciation. When I bought the books in London, I was told that Steve's novels are now assigned by Oxford history dons who tell their students that if they wish to rub shoulders with life in classical Greece, read Pressfield.</p><p> How does an artist achieve that power? In the second book Pressfield lays out the day-by-day, step-by-step campaign of the professional: preparation, order, patience, endurance, acting in the face of fear and failure-no excuses, no bullshit. And best of all, Steve's brilliant insight that first, last, and always, the professional focuses on mastery of the craft.</p><p> Book Three, "The Higher Realm," looks at Inspiration, that sublime result that blossoms in the furrows of the professional who straps on the harness and plows the fields of his or her art. In Pressfield's words: "When we sit down each day and do our work, power concentrates around us...we become like a magnetized rod that attracts iron filings. Ideas come. Insights accrete." On this, the <i>effect</i> of Inspiration, Steve and I absolutely agree. Indeed, stunning images and ideas arrive as if from nowhere. In fact, these seemingly spontaneous flashes are so amazing, it's hard to believe that our unworthy selves created them. From where, therefore, does our best stuff come?</p><p> It's on this point, however, the <i>cause</i> of Inspiration, that we see things differently. In Book One Steve traces Resistance down its evolutionary roots to the genes. I agree. The cause is genetic. That negative force, that dark antagonism to creativity, is embedded deep in our humanity. But in Book Three he shifts gears and looks for the cause of Inspiration not in human nature, but on a "higher realm." Then with a poetic fire he lays out his belief in muses and angels. The ultimate source of creativity, he argues, is divine. Many, perhaps most readers, will find Book Three profoundly moving.</p><p> I, on the other hand, believe that the source of creativity is found on the same plane of reality as Resistance. It, too, is genetic. It's called talent: the innate power to discover the hidden connection between two things-images, ideas, words-that no one else has ever seen before, link them, and create for the world a third, utterly unique work. Like our IQ, talent is a gift from our ancestors. If we're lucky, we inherit it. In the fortunate talented few, the dark dimension of their natures will first resist the labor that creativity demands, but once they commit to the task, their talented side stirs to action and rewards them with astonishing feats. These flashes of creative genius seem to arrive from out of the blue for the obvious reason: They come from the unconscious mind. In short, if the Muse exists, she does not whisper to the untalented.</p><p> So although Steve and I may differ on the cause, we agree on the effect: When inspiration touches talent, she gives birth to truth and beauty. And when Steven Pressfield was writing <i>The War of Art</i>, she had her hands all over him.</p><br><b>Steven Pressfield</b> is the author of international bestsellers <i>The Legend of Bagger Vance, Gates of Fire, Tides of War, </i>and <i>Last of the Amazons</i>.

Murray considered missions to be "the chief end of the church." Andrew pastored churches in Bloemfontein, Worcester, Cape Town and Wellington, all in South Africa. He was a champion of the South African Revival of 1860. In 1889, he was one of the founders of the South African General Mission (SAGM), along with Martha Osborn and Spencer Walton. After Martha Osborn married George Howe, they formed the South East Africa General Mission (SEAGM) in 1891. SAGM and SEAGM merged in 1894. Because its ministry had spread into other African countries, the mission's name was changed to Africa Evangelical Fellowship (AEF) in 1965. AEF joined with SIM in 1998 and continues to this day. He died on January 18, 1917, four months before his eighty-ninth birthday. Over the years he has influenced many, including Jessie Penn-Lewis, a key figure in the 1904-1905 Welsh Revival.</p><h2>4400 Guitar Chords</h2><p>Features more than 4,400 playable guitar chords, chords featured in black and white diagrams, diagrams in all positions from the first to the fifteenth fret and nine special guitar arrangements for one or two guitars.</p><p></p><h2>Raising Rabbits the Modern Way</h2><p>Provides information on feeding, housing, showing, selling, and breeding rabbits, and offers advice on raising rabbits as a business</p><p>Completely revised Garden Way Publishing Classic on raising rabbits.<p> * Contains the most recent how-to information for successfully raising rabbits on a small to semicommercial scale. </p><p> * All new information on feeding, housing, medication, breeding, showing, and selling.</p><p> * Contains all the basics, experienced solutions, modern techniques, from inspecting the litter to ARBA registration system.</p><p> * Includes updated product information and equipment lists.</p><p>Bob Bennett is the author of six books on rabbit raising, including <i>Storey's Guide to Raising Rabbits,</i>&nbsp;as well as numerous magazine and newspaper articles.

Stone is carted off with FDR New Dealers Bernard Baruch, Supreme Court justice Felix Frankfurter, and other real famous men by President Lindbergh's gestapo-style FBI as pogroms begin in America. Roth's novel vividly relates the fear among American Jews in 1942 when fascism was a real threat. Back then, journalist I. F. Stone was among the alarmed who excoriated isolationist Lindbergh's coziness with the Third Reich. </p><p> Uncanny echoes of Stone are heard in concert halls, on radio, or on CDs of the Kronos Quartet as his distinctive voice dips in and out of the music. With a continued war in Iraq, the Kronos Quartet and composer Scott Johnson found new poignancy and symbolism in Stone's antiwar lectures for peace taped decades ago and incorporated into "How It Happens," Johnson's 1993 work for amplified string quartet. Stone's twenty-two-year-old words punctuate a world that remains as frightening as when he spoke them -- a combustible Middle East, North Korean and Iranian nuclear threats, and a messy, unnecessary war in Iraq -- "How much bloodshed, cruelty, suffering? How many survivors to wonder? Was it a Canadian goose, or a real ICBM heading one way or the other, that set off the great conflagration? Think what would have happened if -- " Stone's voice is deliberately and dramatically ended in midsentence. </p><p> What appears to be a fleeting apparition of owl-eyed Izzy rushes by in the background of real footage of a McCarthy hearing in George Clooney's award-winning 2005 movie on Edward R. Murrow, <i>Good Night, and Good Luck.</i> </p><p> The twentieth century's premier independent journalist, known to everyone from the corner grocer to Einstein as Izzy, is honored on campuses that award I. F. Stone chairs, fellowships, and scholarships. Institutions rank his tiny one-man <i>Weekly</i> in the Greatest Hits of twentieth-century journalism. In one major study, Stone's <i>Weekly</i> placed number 16 in the top 100, behind coverage of Hiroshima, Watergate, the Pentagon Papers, My Lai, and the work of early-century muckrakers. As an individual voice, he placed ahead of Harrison Salisbury, Dorothy Thompson, Neil Sheehan, William Shirer, James Baldwin, Joan Didion, Murray Kempton, and other worthies. Some who once ruled Georgetown and political society, such as columnist Joe Alsop and the acerbic H. L. Mencken, did not make the cut. Walter Lippmann placed 64. Such are the vicissitudes of life for journalists who once stood so high. "This kind of list is needed in journalism,'' said Mitchell Stephens, of NYU. "Nobody thinks of journalism in terms of decades or centuries.'' It is important to examine why some endure. </p><p> And Stone endures. He is quoted in the <i>New Yorker</i> and the <i>New York Times,</i> remembered as an inspiration by Bill Moyers and Seymour Hersh -- arguably the best investigative reporter today -- and anyone else who despairs of modern journalism, especially the unquestioning acceptance of governmental spin. He is a lone "courageous" voice remembered by Michael Cross-Barnet in a 2005 recollection of his own father's ruined career during the Red Scare: <i>"The New York Times</i> Shafted My Father." Defending the <i>Times</i> editor Melvin Barnet, Stone had asked back then, "How can the <i>Times</i> editorially support the Fifth Amendment and discharge those who invoke it?" Bloggers bill themselves as the next Izzy. Then the right-wing chorus falsely called Stone a Red spy. The list goes on. </p><p> Stone went from a young iconoclast in the 1930s to an icon during the Vietnam War. In the fifties, he spoke to mere handfuls who dared surface to protest Cold War loyalty oaths and witch hunts. A decade later, he spoke to half a million who massed for anti-Vietnam War rallies. He became world famous. </p><p> </p><p> Today, Izzy's remarkable immediacy leaps off the pages. Not only is he a sheer joy to read, his views take on vital importance, as if he had written them just this morning, illuminating the tumultuous first five years of the twenty-first century. </p><p> <i>"There was increased reliance at home and abroad on suppression by force and an increasingly arrogant determination to 'go it alone' in the world."</i> This was not written when George W. Bush ignored the United Nations, colleagues, international treaties, and advice of allies and started a war but by Stone during Cold War escalation. </p><p> <i>"All governments are run by liars..."</i> This was not about the weapons of mass destruction or subsequent other Iraq War lies but those told during the Vietnam War. </p><p> <i>"It is not a private quarrel between the Israelis and Arabs. It's a world concern -- and of great concern to America, as a great power, to have stability and peace. And there is no way to have peace without some modicum of justice. The Arabs can not be held in second-class citizenship and bondage. If something isn't done pretty soon the lines may harden, each side will destroy its own moderates -- and then they will move on to destroy each other."</i> That was not about today's discord or the wall built by the Israelis to keep out the Palestinians in 2004, but Stone's sorrowful warning years ago. </p><p> <i>"Almost every generation in American history has had to face what appeared to be a menace of so frightening an order as to justify the limitation of basic liberties -- the Francophiles in the days of the Alien and Sedition laws, the Abolitionists, the Anarchists, the Socialists in the days of Debs; Fascists, anti-Semites and Communists in our own time."</i> Some saw "compelling arguments for suppression." Stone argued against this, claiming that a country founded on basic freedoms had "managed to get through before." This was not about the excesses of the Patriot Act but about investigative assaults and secret surveillance of citizens in 1949. Then as now, fear galvanized citizens into silent support. The terrorists of 9/11 and continuing worldwide terrorism made it easy to sell the Patriot Act -- and to resell it to a cowardly Congress as 2005 drew to a close. The very name echoes those deployed the Cold War Red Scare, when congressional inquisitors decided who was "un-American" and President Truman instituted the "Loyalty Oath." Stone would have led the pack in uncovering -- once again -- illegal domestic spying in the twenty-first century and ripped into the Patriot Act for its trampling on the Bill of Rights, which included forcing clerks and librarians to turn over lists of what citizens read, and detaining a thousand "suspects" with no evidence. Jailed without charge, forbidden to see lawyers or family, the vast majority were innocent of federal crimes of terrorism. Bush's team had grossly inflated the number of terrorist actions. Justice Department stonewalling thwarted media access, yet available reports were overlooked. Such documents would have had hound dog Stone salivating at the joy of the hunt. </p><p> <i>"There still seem to be many worthy gentlemen...who wish to anchor the world in a sea of narrow minds (including their own) and hold it there, lest it move forward...They are utterly out of place in this age of rationalism."</i> This was not about the current forces of Creationism but the first go around, with the famous 1920s Scopes Monkey Trial and written by a fourteen-year-old Izzy. </p><p> </p><p> This book combines biography, a historical treatise on the press, and Stone's running commentary on twentieth-century America. All are necessary to draw some present-day lessons from the life and times of I. F. Stone. At pivotal points in their careers I have twinned outsider I. F. Stone with insider Walter Lippmann because they are dynamic examples of opposing approaches to journalism. Presidents and kings were so much a part of Lippmann's life that when he visited Paris, his forwarding address was in care of Charles de Gaulle. He wrote speeches for presidents and never saw the dichotomy, lecturing younger colleagues like James (Scotty) Reston to remain detached. "Walter was more engaged with more presidents from Wilson to Lyndon Johnson than <i>anybody</i> in the press! He was always in the White House," Reston once exclaimed to me. Meanwhile, Stone was blackballed by the National Press Club after his premature gesture of civility in a Jim Crow era, inviting a black to lunch there. </p><p> A vital companion theme is the repression of dissent that Stone and others faced in the twentieth century and which continues to this day. Stone never confused dissent with disloyalty, as mainstream media and the government so often do. Stone fervently loved this country, viewing dissenting voices as crucial for keeping it true to its ideals. </p><p> Since Stone wrote and thought everything out loud in the public arena, there are no private papers or memos and only sparse correspondence -- the stuff of conventional biographies. Because of this, one extraordinary lie has been promulgated by the far right bent on besmirching Stone's legacy. They repeat the falsehood that Stone's family burned his papers, hinting at some dark conspiracy. They deduced this from <i>Nation</i> writer D. D. Guttenplan's innocent observations that Stone had left no papers. After more than a decade of examining Stone, I can sadly attest to Guttenplan's accuracy and applaud his continual debunking of Izzy-the-spy lies that the neocons ...</p></p><h2>Silk Ribbon Embroidery: Designs &amp; Techniques</h2><p>Over a hundred photographs demonstrate the techniques&nbsp;and clearly illustrate how to make roses, hollyhocks, geraniums, Canterbury bells, fuschias, lilies, irises, poppies, primulas, Chinese lanterns, and much more.

Now Adam wants to meet her at a romantic beach, and Susanna just knows it&#x2019;s to pop the question. But not so. Emotionally devastated, Susanna drives away, only to have a flat tire in the ironic location of the fabled Lover&#x2019;s Oak. To add to her stress, a rough-looking man won&#x2019;t leave her alone. Nathaniel stops to help. He hasn&#x2019;t had a serious girlfriend in 10 years, and it&#x2019;s love at first sight. There&#x2019;s a complication, however. Nathaniel is a royal prince, next in line to be the king of Brighton Kingdom. And since his father is dying, Nathaniel has little time to find a suitable bride and begin producing heirs. Hauck has created an enchanting novel featuring a charming hero and heroine as well as interesting secondary characters, such as a woman who leaves her job as a lobbyist to live in a tent in the woods. This modern fairy tale, told from a faith-based perspective, is the first book in the Royal Wedding series. --Shelley Mosley</p><h2>A Brief History of the Knights Templar</h2><p>The Knights of the Order of the Temple of Solomon are found in fictional literature from the Middle Ages to Sir Walter Scott and beyond, even appearing in computer games.

Delos is a member of the Allied Worlds of Earth, who steadfastly maintain neutrality in the war between the Traders and my people, the Skolians. Despite die fact that all of us are human--Allieds, Traders, and Skolians alike--we have little in common. So Earth declared Delos a neutral zone, sanctuary, a place where Trader and Skolian soldiers could walk together in harmony.<br>Harmony was their word, not ours. You'd never have caught one of us walking with a Trader soldier, in harmony or otherwise.<br>But Delos was the planet easiest to reach from the region of space where my squad had been running flight drills to integrate Taas, our newest member, into the group. So Delos was where we came for our well-earned rest and relaxation.<br>The evening was warm as the four of us walked along the Arcade. A hodgepodge of stalls and shops stretched the length of the boardwalk, eaves hung with wooden chimes that clacked in the wind, and with streamers dyed green, yellow, blue, and plump-pod red. At the apex of each turreted roof a pole reached toward the sky. Metal plates hung from the poles, clanking heartily as gusts tossed them against one another, their chatter melding with the voices of the people who strolled among the shops and games. It was a place of festival and laughter, a haven for the bright women in their flutter-yellow skirts, and for the strapping young men in billowing trousers who pursued them.<br>As we strolled along the boardwalk, its nervoplex surface shifted under our feet, making me grit my teeth. I had never understood why most people liked the stuff. No, that wasn't true. I understood, I just didn't share that fondness. Nervoplex supposedly heightened comfort and pleasure. The network of molecular fibers and nano-sized computer chips woven into it reacted to the distribution of weight it experienced, letting the boardwalk analyze and interact with the pedestrian traffic almost as if it sensed their moods.<br>In an open area on our right, people clustered around a pair of wrestlers in red and green outfits who were putting on a demonstration. As the crowd milled and stamped, the nervoplex rippled in response, magnifying their enjoyment of the show.<br>The four of us--Rex, Helda, Taas, and myself--walked alone. The boardwalk around us was stiff and motionless. I wished we had civilian clothes. We weren't on duty, after all. But all we had were our Jagernaut uniforms: black pants tucked into black boots, black vests, black jackets. In the bright crowds, our unrelieved black drew attention like rocks falling into water. The river of pedestrians split around us as if it were a waterway parted by boulders. They were mostly Earth citizens, people not likely to have seen even one Jagernaut in person before, let alone four of us.<br>Rex glanced at me, his handsome face flashing with a wicked grin. "You should start yelling and foaming at the mouth, Soz. That would clear this place out fast."<br>I glared at him. The "Jagernaut runs amok" plot was a favorite in the holomovies. We were bioengineered fighter pilots, elite officers in the Space Command of Skolia. The prospect that one of us would go crazy and attack everyone in sight had made a lot of holomovie producers annoyingly rich.<br>"I'll foam your mouth," I grumbled.<br>Rex smiled. "That sounds interesting."<br>Helda spoke in her throaty accent. "You remember Garth Byler?"<br>Rex glanced at her. "He entered the Dieshan Military Academy as a cadet the year I graduated."<br>Helda nodded. She was as big as Rex, towering over both Taas and me. Her hair hung around her face like honeycorn straw. "He went to a heartbender."<br>The nervoplex under my feet stiffened. I slowed down, trying to relax. There was no need to tense up; "heart-bender" was just the slang we used for the psychiatrists who treated Jagernauts who broke under the strain of a war that had gone beyond the capabilities of normal humans to fight it. But if one of us did snap, and it happened more often than Space Command admitted, we usually did it quietly. Any violence was almost always directed inward, not at other people.<br>"What happened to him?" Taas asked.<br>"Went to the hospital," Helda said. "Then he retired."<br>I rubbed the back of my hand across my forehead, unable to concentrate on die conversation. My pulse and breathing had speeded up, and sweat garnered on my temples, dampening curls of my hair. What was the matter with me?<br>Then I saw it. Across the Arcade, two people were watching us, a young man and woman dressed in imported jeans and glittery hotshirts. They looked like students, maybe lovers out for a stroll. Neither of them was smiling. They just stood staring at us, their snack-sticks dangling forgotten in their hands.<br>Tightness constricted around my chest like a metal band. I stopped walking and took a deep breath. <i>Block</i>, I thought.<br>I didn't get the response I expected. All I should have seen when I gave the Block command was a psicon, a small picture similar to die icons on a computer, except that psicons appeared in die mind. It should have flashed and disappeared. Instead, the image of a computer menu formed in my mind. I closed my eyes and the menu wavered like die afterimage of a bright light on my eyelids. When I opened my eyes, my perception shifted so that I saw the menu hanging in the air in front of me like a holographic image. It showed me three commands:<br>* * *<br>Transfer<br>Block<br>Exit<br>* * *<br>The letters were in my personal font, which made them look as if they were carved out of amber. Next to the word Block I saw the picture of a neural synapse with a wall between the axon and dendrite. That picture was the Block psicon I had expected to flash in my mind. Instead it sat here, floating in the air, part of a big menu waiting for my attention. Rex and Helda had stopped next to me and were talking to each other, oblivious to the list of words I saw superimposed on them.<br>The people from Earth had a good saying for times like this. Frigging rockets. Better yet, flaming frigging rockets. What was this menu doing, hanging in the air? No, that was the wrong question. I knew why it was there. The computer node implanted in my spine had produced it when I sent a command by thinking the word Block. It accessed my optic nerve to make the menu appear in front of me.<br>Except it shouldn't have happened. I had set up my systems to bypass this procedure. It was far too inefficient--not to mention distracting--to go through the whole process every time I gave a command to my spinal node. The only response I should have seen to my Block command was the flash of the synapse-and-wall psicon letting me know the node was working.<br>I just thought of the computer in my spine as "the node." I named most computers I worked with, but not this one. It would have been too much like calling myself by someone else's name, as if I were doubling or splitting my personality.<br>I formed another thought for the node. <i>Switch to Brief mode</i>.<br>Its response came into my mind as if it were my own thought, but phrased in the node's usual bone-dry verbiage. Recommend Verification mode. Too much time has passed since you last confirmed blocking operations.<br>So. It wanted to run a check. I knew die routine; the node would show me every step it followed to execute my Block command. Usually die process went at close to the speed of light, which was the limit to how fast signals could travel along the fiberoptic threads in my body. But right now it wanted me to plod through the whole excruciating routine to make sure there were no errors in it.<br><i>All right</i>, I thought. <i>Do the check</i>.<br>The menu faded. Then the node produced a new image.<br>This one also hung in the air like a holo, a blue silhouette of the two students who were still staring at us. The node overlaid the silhouette on them so that they looked as if they were glowing with blue light.<br>Input from these two sources exceeds safety tolerances, the node thought.<br><i>I know that</i>. For an empath like myself, their "input" was their fear: I felt it so intensely that sweat had formed on my temples and was running down my neck.<br><i>Block their input</i>, I thought.<br>I am releasing a drug that will inhibit the action of psiamine on the neurons in the para centers of your brain, including attachment to P1 receptors. Inhibition will continue until external input drops below your default safety tolerances.<br>I grimaced. <i>Can't you just say you're blocking them</i>?<br>I am blocking them, the node obliged.<br>The onslaught of fear receded. As my shoulders relaxed and my heart beat slowed, I thought, <i>Procedure verified. Now switch to Brief mode</i>.<br>Brief mode entered.<br>Finally. I glanced around at the others. Taas was standing next to me, staring at the turreted roof of a stall. The students' fear radiated off him like heat off a red-hot ingot.<br>I laid my hand on his arm. "Shut diem out."<br>He didn't move. His face was pale under its usual olive color.<br>"That's an order," I said. "Initiate blocking."<br>Taas jerked. Then he closed his eyes. After a moment he looked at me, his color returning.<br>"You all right?" I asked.<br>"Yes." He winced. "It was so intense. They caught me off guard."<br>"Me too."<br>Rex glanced from me to Taas. Then he turned to the students and I felt him block their input. Although I couldn't pick up Helda as easily, her brief glazed look told me she too had accessed her spinal node. None of them took more than an instant to do the block; apparently their nodes weren't harassing them with verification procedures today.<br>Well, maybe harassing wasn't a fair word. After all, I was the one who had told it to warn me when too long went by without a check.<br>Taas spoke in a low voice. "I don't know why I slipped up like that."<br>"It's this damn nervoplex." I motioned at the boardwalk. "It interacts with the crowd like a mood enhancer." Taas and I were more sensitive to the effect, he because he was the least experienced member of the squad and I because I was the strongest empath.<br>Helda motioned toward the students. "Why do those two over there get so upset? What do they think we do to them, anyway?"<br>Rex turned back to us, speaking in a strangely quiet voice. "I get tired of evoking that reaction." He pushed his hand through his hair, mussing up the black locks. No, not black. More and more white showed at his temple every day.<br>But now what was this? Why did Taas have that odd smile? "What's so funny?" I asked.<br>He flushed. "Ma'am?"<br>"Why are you grinning like that?"<br>He immediately stopped smiling. "Nothing, ma'am."<br>I laughed. "Taas, you don't need to say ma'am." In a group as tightly knit as ours, it made no sense to be so formal. "What was funny?"<br>He hesitated, then motioned toward the students. "That boy had a different reaction to you than he did to the rest of us."<br>"Different?" I blinked. "How?"<br>"He thinks you're--uh..."<br>I waited. "Yes?"<br>Taas reddened. "He thinks you're sexy."<br>I felt my own face flush. "I'm old enough to be his mother."<br>Helda laughed. "Ya, but you look like a youngster, Soz."<br>I smiled. "I do not." In truth, she wasn't the first to tell me that.<br>Rex grinned, and I felt Taas relax. Our group tension trickled away. As Rex started to speak, his gaze shifted to a point beyond me--and his smile vanished like a door slamming shut. I turned to look.<br>Traders.<br>Of course they didn't call themselves Traders. They were Eubians, members of the euphemistically named Eube Concord. There were five of them, all dressed in gray uniforms with blue piping on the pants and crimson braid on the sleeves. Although it was hard to make out the color of their eyes from this far away, I didn't think any of them had the red eyes of an Aristo, a member of the highest caste in the rigid hierarchy of the Concord. One of them did have an Aristo's finely chiseled features, the black hair, even the arrogant stance. And his hair glinted. But it didn't have that liquid shimmering quality so distinctive of an Aristo.<br>Perhaps they were an Aristo's bodyguards. It was one of the more prestigious positions allowed members of the lower Trader castes. My guess was that they were taskmakers, children born from the pairing of an Aristo with a lower caste Trader.<br>They stood across the Arcade staring at us. The crowds continued about their business, bustling along the boardwalk between our group and the Traders.<br>An odd fear grabbed me, one with a nurturing intensity mat, though appealing, wasn't familiar. As my pulse leapt, I looked around and saw a woman hurrying several children away from the area. She glanced at the Traders, then at us, then urged her charges to speed up. The smallest boy balked, trying to head for a stall where sugar candles hung on a wire, the inviting treats dripping sugar instead of wax. The woman pulled him away, ignoring his loud protests as she hurried him through the crowd.<br>Taas scowled at the Traders. "They can't just come here and walk around."<br>"What, you want them to get a license?" Helda asked. Then she added, "We're harmonizing, remember?"<br>"They could be spying," Taas offered.<br>Rex was watching me. "What's wrong?"<br>I swallowed. "That tall one. He looks like Tarque."<br>Rex stiffened. "Tarque is dead."<br>Long dead. Ten years dead. I had killed him.<br>"Who is Tarque?" Helda asked. "It sounds Aristo"<br>Somehow I kept my voice steady. "It is."<br>Rex nudged my mind. After years of working together he and I were close enough so that I could catch his thoughts if he directed them at me with enough force.<br><i>Are you all right</i>? he asked.<br>I took a breath, struggling to keep my pulse steady. <i>Yes</i>.<br>"Where you know this Tarque?" Helda asked me.<br>"I went undercover on Tams Station ten years ago."<br>"Tams?" Taas asked. "You mean the Trader planet?"<br>I nodded. "I got--caught."<br>"They broke your cover?" he asked.<br>"No. I don't mean caught that way." It was a moment before I could continue. "Ten years ago the Traders installed an Aristo governor on Tarns, a man called Kryx Tarque. His people were making sweeps through the cities, selecting servers for his estates." "Server" was the generic term the Aristos used for lower castes, which as far as they were concerned included everyone in the universe who wasn't an Aristo. "I got caught in a sweep."<br>Taas stared at me. "You've been a Trader servant?"<br>"No." I spoke with a calmness I didn't feel. "A provider."<br>Taas blanched, and Helda's muscles bunched up along her shoulders, making her jacket shift position. "Provider" was one of the Aristos' euphemisms, one I never wanted to think about again.<br>Helda rolled her shoulders like a fighter trying to ease out knotted muscles. "How you escape?"<br>I just shook my head. I couldn't talk about it. Across the Arcade, the Traders were talking among themselves, still watching us.<br>Taas spoke awkwardly. "I'm sorry, Primary Valdoria. About Tarns."<br>I tried to make my voice light. "Taas, call me Soz, all right?" I had told him that so many times I had lost count.<br>He reddened. "Yes, ma'am."<br>Helda's thought brushed my mind, far weaker than I had felt from Rex: <i>I also am sorry</i>. Then, more lightly: <i>Give...</i></p><h2>The Catholic Church: A Short History (Modern Library Chronicles)</h2><p>In this extraordinary book, the renowned Hans Kung chronicles the Roman Catholic Church&#x2019;s role as a world power throughout history. He examines great schisms &#x2014; between East and West, Catholicism and Protestantism &#x2014; the evolving role of the papacy and the stories of the great reforming popes; and the expansion of a global Church infrastructure. The book concluded with a searching assessment of how the Catholic faith will confront the immense challenges posed in the new millennium by the scientific community, by women questioning their role in the Church, and by those seeking reform of the strictures against abortion and contraception. <b>The Catholic Church</b> is a landmark book by a controversial and profoundly influential thinker.</p><p>Hans Kung's <i>The Catholic Church: A Short History</i> is a small masterpiece of historical and theological writing.

He begins with Jesus, who "radiated a democratic spirit in the best sense of the word" and "did not proclaim a church, nor did he proclaim himself, but the kingdom of God." Throughout, in his analysis of every phase of Church history, Kung builds a case for a populist church, challenging the idea of a hierarchical Roman Catholic Church led by an infallible pope. The book concludes with a harsh analysis of the Church's betrayal of Vatican II. Kung, the primary writer of Vatican II, was censured by the Vatican in 1979 for questioning Church doctrine and banned from teaching as a Catholic theologian. Here, Kung levels particular criticism toward Pope John Paul II, whose primary accomplishment, he argues, has been to revive a "conservative and authoritarian" spirit in the Church. The pope's conservative views on the ordination of women, sexual morality, mixed marriages, and ecumenism draw Kung's fire. He calls for nothing less than a new Vatican council in order to bring the Church hierarchy back in line with the Church faithful. <blockquote>The view of the papacy held by the Catholic Church fellowship, oriented on the New Testament, is different from that of the Roman church bureaucracy. It is the view of a pope who is not <i>over</i> the church and the world in place of God, but <i>in</i> the church as a member (instead of the head) of the people of God.</blockquote> <i>The Catholic Church</i> is the best history of the Church in many years. Unlike many such books, it is written clearly enough to be understood by lay readers, regardless of their knowledge of Christian history; and it is short enough that it can be read in a day or two. Furthermore, Kung's controversial views are not presented as mere polemic. They are grounded in objective historical facts. Thus, he succeeds in providing a history that is both committed and objective. Readers who share those commitments will find a trove of knowledge to support their beliefs; readers who disagree will be moved to consider carefully the question of whether and how the Church should be further reformed. --<i>Michael Joseph Gross</i>&#x201c;This much-needed book tells the truth about the Catholic past for the sake of the church&#x2019;s future.&#x201d; &#x2014;James Carroll<br><br>&#x201c;Hans K�ng has done more to shape contemporary Catholic hope than anyone else, and with <i>The Catholic Church </i>he does it again.&#x201d; &#x2014;James Carroll, author of <i>Constantine&#x2019;s Sword</i><br><br>&#x201c;One of the greatest theologians of the twentieth century, Hans K�ng . . . is one of the world&#x2019;s great mavericks. . . .

Pythagoreans, Kabbalists, neo-Platonists, and medieval Catholic mystics regarded the alphabet as a code that explained the universe. Drucker (art history, Yale) examines these and other ideas about the origins and inherent meanings of the alphabet, relating them to their intellectual milieu. She also discusses developments in the forms of the letters. She notes, for example, how modern typefaces, first developed in the late 18th century, embody Enlightenment philosophy. Her well-written discussion is enriched with over 300 illustrations drawn from important texts and documents.

Then comes another bloody death. Who is the real killer?</p><p><b>Phil Rickman</b> is the author of the John Dee series and the&nbsp;Merrily Watkins series.At the start of British author Rickman&#39;s assured novella, the 13th entry in his Merrily Watkins paranormal series (after 2014&#39;s The Magus of Hay), Zoe Mahonie and her husband, Jonathan, discover that their new home in Hereford, England, was previously occupied by Susan Lulham, a hair stylist who slashed herself to death in the living room some years earlier. After finding the dead woman&#39;s nickname, Suze, scrawled across a mirror in red lipstick, Zoe suspects that the house is haunted by her restless spirit. Zoe asks Merrily, the local diocesan exorcist, to exorcise the building, but Merrily&#39;s efforts turn into a public fiasco when Zoe films the rite and posts the video online. Things only get worse after another person dies on the premises, leaving Merrily to ascertain whether the cause of the new unnatural death was natural or supernatural.

Today, everyone knows him as Giotto, the pre-Renaissance master whose magnificent frescoes illuminate the Church of St. Francis in Assisi and the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua. <i>In A Boy Named Giotto</i>, Paolo Guarnieri tells a story of how young Giotto might have been apprenticed to the great master Cimabue and taught how to paint frescoes. In legendary fashion, Cimabue, as any other artist of the times might have done, realizes that the student has outdone the master and will subsequently find a permanent place of honor in the history of art. Bimba Landmann's stunning paintings, with highlights of glittering gilt, call to mind the work of Giotto but exude a style that is distinctly Landmann's own. <br></p><p>"In the pasture, instead of keeping watch over the flock, Giotto spends his time sketching." He may not be much of a shepherd, but this talented 8-year-old boy doesn't have to remain one for long; after timidly introducing himself to the painter Cimabue, he becomes the Florentine painter's prot�g�--and before long Cimabue looks at Giotto's work and thinks, "the pupil has outdone the master." The present tense lends immense vitality to this simple exercise in biography, written by Italian art critic Paolo Guarnieri and translated by Jonathan Galassi. The lively, immediate story is perfectly matched by the stunning paintings of Guarnieri's wife, Bimba Landmann, which imitate the style of the great pre-Renaissance master while maintaining their own absolutely modern flavor. Children who find themselves absorbed in drawing, music, or any project other than the one at hand will find young Giotto's story inspirational. (Click to see a sample spread.

More than half of the millionaires in the United States lived in the city. Previously unimaginable sums of money were made and spent, while poor immigrants were packed in tenements. The gap between the rich and the poor was wide, yet wealth was flaunted at every opportunity, from showy parties to lavish clothing and richly furnished mansions.

From 1949 through 1967, Bess showed at the Betty Parsons Gallery in New York City, alongside superstar artists such as Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko. Rediscovered after his death in 1977, Bess's small visionary paintings are now prized by museums and collectors for their primal beauty, and can fetch over $200,000 apiece.<br><br>Bess's treasured canvases were only part of a grander theory&#x2014;based on alchemy, Jungian philosophy, and aboriginal rituals&#x2014;that proposed that hermaphrodism was the key to immortality.

For the first time ever in print, <b><i>Forrest Bess: Key to the Riddle</i></b> combines the beauty of Bess's art with the drama and tragedy of his personal life.

A machine of frightening power and sinister beauty, the Grosser 770K Model 150 <i>Offener Tourenwagen</i> was 20 feet long, seven feet wide, and tipped the scales at 5 tons. Its supercharged, 230-horsepower engine propelled the beast to speeds over 100 m.p.h. while its occupants reclined on glove-leather seats stuffed with goose down. Armor plated and equipped with hidden compartments for Luger pistols, the 770K was a sumptuous monster with a monstrous patron: Adolph Hitler and the Nazi party.</p><p>Deployed mainly for propaganda purposes before the war, the hand-built limousines&#x2015;in which Hitler rode standing in the front seat&#x2015;motored through elaborate rallies and appeared in countless newsreels, swiftly becoming the Nazi party&#x2019;s most durable symbol of wealth and power. Had Hitler not so thoroughly dominated the scene with his own megalomania, his opulent limousine could easily have eclipsed him.</p><p> Most of the 770Ks didn&#x2019;t make it out of the rubble of World War II. But several of them did. And two of them found their way, secretly and separately, to the United States.</p><p> In <i>The Devil&#x2019;s Mercedes</i>, author Robert Klara uncovers the forgotten story of how Americans responded to these rolling relics of fascism on their soil. The limousines made headlines, drew crowds, made fortunes and ruined lives. What never became public was how both of the cars would ultimately become tangled in a web of confusion, mania, and opportunism, fully entwined in a story of mistaken identity.</p><p> Nobody knew that the limousine touted as Hitler&#x2019;s had in fact never belonged to him, while the Mercedes shrugged off as an ordinary staff car&#x2015;one later abandoned in a warehouse and sold off as government surplus&#x2015;turned out to be none other than Hitler&#x2019;s personal automobile.</p><p> It would take 40 years, a cast of carnies and millionaires, the United States Army, and the sleuthing efforts of an obscure Canadian librarian to bring the entire truth to light.</p><p> As he recounts this remarkable drama, Klara probes the meaning of these haunting hulks and their power to attract, excite and disgust. The limousines&#x2019; appearance collided with an American populous celebrating a victory even as it sought to stay a step ahead of the war&#x2019;s ghosts.

Disturbingly, I missed that control. I didn&#x2019;t know what to do once I had no one there to tell me how to dress, act, and behave; what to want; and who, even, to be. In some ways, I missed the abuse. I missed the pain. I missed being scared. Not because I liked feeling any of that.

Born in Pittsburgh, she grew up in Minneapolis and studied art at Grinnell College and the University of Iowa. "It was only after my children were born that I became acquainted with children's books and it occurred to me that I could use my training to become a children's book illustrator. I soon realized that I needed a text to go with the pictures, and the more I wrote, the more I realized that I liked writing as much as or more than drawing. I've always been fascinated by the natural world and love to go to the parks and museums. Perhaps that is why so many of my books are about scientific topics." Arnold is now the award-winning author of more than 100 books for children. She lives in Los Angeles with her husband, a neuroscientist, and teaches writing at UCLA Extension. <p>Laurie Caple is the illustrator of Giant Shark and Dinosaurs with Feathers, both by Caroline Arnold She lives in northern Wisconsin.</p>Grade 2-5-After a brief explanation of the Ice Age, the team that created Giant Shark (2000) and Dinosaurs with Feathers (2001, both Clarion) introduces the various mammoths and their relatives and then describes some of the most important fossil finds and what scientists have learned from them. Arnold doesn't shy away from the difficult names and vocabulary required by this topic, but her clear explanations aid readers in understanding the time period, the relationships among the various species, and the scientific processes involved in studying fossils. Caple's watercolors are realistic, detailed, and surprisingly beautiful. A soft sunset behind a row of traveling mastodons, the hint of a stand of evergreens glimpsed through snow and mist, the glow of torchlight on the face of a prehistoric painter all draw readers into the mystery of these lost animals and the humans who saw them. An index makes this a useful research tool, but fans of prehistoric mammals will read the book cover to cover.

It&#x2019;s the same feeling you have when you wake up for the first time after someone you love has tragically and suddenly died. The reality of it comes flooding back to you and you realize it wasn&#x2019;t a bad dream after all. You wish with all of your being that it was not true, but it is and you have to face it. The thought of getting through the day brings such a weight of depression it requires a major effort to even get out of bed. <p>That&#x2019;s exactly the way I always felt, even though no one had died. No one, that is, except me. I was dying on a daily basis. I could feel it, but I didn&#x2019;t know what to do about it.</p> <p>No one ever saw my struggle, so I pretended everything was fine. And I got very good at it. I stayed as busy as possible, with as many people as possible, in order to create a diversion so grand that I didn&#x2019;t have to feel the terrible purposelessness of my life. But there was always that moment of extreme aloneness, with no noise and no activity, when I crossed over from sleep to consciousness. In those first waking moments, the deafening quiet exposed the futility of my life and it was unbearable.</p> <p>I often thought of suicide as a means of escape because I didn&#x2019;t want to wake up again with that dreaded feeling and have to face another day. I certainly couldn&#x2019;t imagine that things could ever be any different from the way they were. I had spent a lifetime trying to transform myself and to change my circumstances, and I found I was completely powerless to do so. The way I was and the way my life was going had been entirely unacceptable to me for far too long. And I could see no other way out.</p> <p>Of course I had been on an extensive search to find meaning for my life. But the god I was pursuing in my occult practices was a weak and distant god who really couldn&#x2019;t do anything for me unless I could be good enough, or enlightened enough, or religious enough, or smart enough to somehow get to him and prove I was worthy. I was fairly certain he had more important things to do than help me.</p> <p>Realizing that I was without a god or anyone else to come to my aid, I decided it was all up to me. I was in charge of my destiny. I had to make myself acceptable to others. I had to make my life the way it should be. The problem was, I knew I couldn&#x2019;t do it.</p> <p>I had been a singer and an actress on television for about eight years, and I was finding it increasingly difficult to hide behind either of those occupations for any length of time. The emptiness inside of me was growing at an alarming rate, and I felt so fragile that I knew it wouldn&#x2019;t take much for me to crack like an eggshell.</p> <p>One week I was asked to sing on a series of recording sessions for a Christian musical. I was glad to have the work, and making records was far easier than the labor-intensive schedule of a television show. Back in those days we did TV shows live, so the rehearsal schedule was intense. You had to have the dance routine, dialogue, and songs you were singing down so perfectly that you wouldn&#x2019;t make a mistake when the cameras were rolling and you were seen live in front of millions of people. </p> <p>When I arrived at the recording studio for the first session, it was filled with people, most of whom I had never met. There was a sense of peace and calm, and everyone was friendly, warm, and welcoming&#x2013;quite different from what I was used to in television. My spirits began to lift immediately. This was amazing because it was an early morning session, which means I had not had much time to work out of my traditional early morning depression. </p> <p>During the first break of the day I met more of the singers, musicians, and recording crew. They all had certain common qualities about them that I found very appealing: a sense of simplicity, fullness, and purpose. Someone might question how I could identify a sense of fullness, and I don&#x2019;t know how to explain it, except to say that it stood in stark contrast to my own emptiness. I could also sense that they were not into drugs, alcohol, and promiscuity. Again, there was that contrast.</p> <p>My friend Terry was the contractor on this session, which meant she was in charge of hiring all of the singers. She was one of the best studio singers in Los Angeles, and I had worked with her often. She always sang the lead and I would stand next to her and sing second. I think she liked working with me because I never tried to compete with her. Instead, I recognized her expertise and tried to blend as well as I could with what she did. She took me under her wing at this session because she was aware that I didn&#x2019;t know many people there.</p> <p>We were all singing three to a microphone. On our microphone, Terry was in the middle and another girl and I were on either side of her, looking off the same metal music stand. After that first break was over and we were recording again, I reached up to adjust my headphones. When I brought my hand down, the gold ring on my hand hit the metal music stand and made a loud bang. That brought the session to an immediate halt. </p> <p>This was back in the days when there were none of the technological tricks studios have today. A mistake of this magnitude meant we had to start that whole section of music all over again, which was not good because it had been perfect up to that point. I feared that my recording career was over. Normally something like this could have been enough to keep me from getting called to work again. It wasn&#x2019;t just that I had made a mistake; it was the money it cost the producers for the time involved in having to record it all over again.</p> <p>I felt badly about what happened and apologized profusely. I expected to receive angry glares, a severe shunning at lunch break, and a call asking me not to come back for the rest of the sessions. Instead, everyone acted like it was no big deal and as if they still valued me as a person. The only thing that happened was that the conductor politely said if anyone else was wearing rings or bracelets we should remove them, which we all did. I felt like crying at that point, not just because of making the mistake, but because of the love and mercy I had been shown. It was not the norm in my experience.</p> <p>It was on our lunch break, when we went out together in a large group, that I learned that everyone on the session was a Christian except me. They all talked about their futures, some of which I gathered were even more precarious than mine. Yet none of them feared the future as I did. I feared I didn&#x2019;t have one. They knew they had one because they understood God had a plan for their lives. They said that as long as they walked in the will of God, their future was secure in His hands. I had never heard of such a thing.</p> <p>Obviously their God was different from the gods I had been pursuing. He was personal. He was warm. He had a plan for each person&#x2019;s life. I didn&#x2019;t say anything about my situation because I did not want to expose that I wasn&#x2019;t a Christian and possibly embarrass Terry. She already knew that I was not a believer, but I didn&#x2019;t think that the others did. Now, looking back, I&#x2019;m sure they all knew. They were probably as much aware of my emptiness as I was of their fullness.</p> <p>Each day of the sessions I found myself increasingly attracted to the sense of purpose these people had about their lives. I wanted that so badly, but I didn&#x2019;t know how I could even get close to it. I was sure that a person must have to be born under a different star than I was in order to attain it. Yet I couldn&#x2019;t get the idea of God&#x2019;s will out of my mind.</p> <p>I wonder if God has a plan for my life? I thought to myself. That would mean I didn&#x2019;t have to make life happen. But what if His plan for me is to be a missionary in Siberia? Death would be better. How do I find out what God&#x2019;s plan is for me?</p> <p>I thought about this for the next few days of the sessions. I tried to learn more from each of the singers at every lunch break without letting them know why I was interested. I didn&#x2019;t want anyone pressuring me to have a life of purpose. Besides, being miserable was familiar to me, and I was more comfortable with what I knew.</p> <p>After the last session on the final day, as I was in my car on the way home, I prayed to this God of theirs without knowing if He could even hear me. "God, if You have a will for my life," I said, "I need to know what it is and what to do about it."</p> <p>I heard no reply. As I suspected, this God would probably never listen to someone like me. I went on with my life as it was, spiraling downward at an ever-increasing pace.</p> <p>Over the course of the next few months many things happened to me, one of which changed my life forever: I met the God that Terry and her friends had been talking about. The simple prayer I had prayed in the car, to a God I didn&#x2019;t even know, was answered.</p> <p>That was thirty-one years ago, and now I know that the will of God is not some mysterious thing that only a few select people can understand. It&#x2019;s there for each one of us, but we have to take the necessary steps to find it. The steps are simple, but often for that very reason we don&#x2019;t bother to take them. Yet we have to take them because we can never be happy until we understand God&#x2019;s will for our lives and are living in it.</p> <p>Until we are living in the will of God, we are destined to have lives that are unfulfilled and incomplete. Knowing that God has a plan for you gives your life purpose as nothing else can. It simplifies everything because you don&#x2019;t have to figure it all out and make it all happen. You just have to look to the Lord, knowing He has it all figured out and He will make it happen.</p> <p>From that time on, I continually prayed, "God, tell me what to do. Show me what steps to take. Guide me where I need to go." And God answered those prayers. He spoke to my heart saying, "Just be in My presence. I&#x2019;ll make things happen the way they are supposed to."</p> <p>In the following months and years I learned that life could be much simpler than I ever dreamed. It didn&#x2019;t matter what my situation was at the moment; all I had to do was take the next step the Lord was showing me. As I did, I began to see a solid way of living, which I could explain to other people. I could say, "You just take these steps. As long as you are walking with God and living His way, you are not likely to get off the path. And if by chance you do, He will get you right back on. That&#x2019;s because you&#x2019;ve been listening to God&#x2019;s voice and you will feel in your heart when you violate one of His directions."</p> <p>The following chapters in this book are the basic steps to take to establish an intimate relationship with God, to lay a solid foundation in His truth, and to learn the basic principles of obedience. All of these things are the will of God for your life, as revealed in His Word, and you must do them in order to be in the will of God.</p> <p>At the end of each chapter are short prayers and a section called Tools of Truth. These are Scripture verses that are God&#x2019;s truth for your life. You can claim them as God&#x2019;s will for you, and they will give you security and confidence.</p> <p>I suggest that you pray for yourself every day for a month, using each one of the twenty areas of prayer focus I have included in this book. Pray a chapter a day for a twenty-day prayerful walk to spiritual well-being. </p> <p>Now let me tell you about each of these steps and how I learned of their importance in our lives.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>My War</h2><p>One of America&#39;s favorite commentators writes a moving, funny, and highly evocative account of his life as an Army private and Stars and Stripes reporter during World War II. Published to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the end of the war in Europe, My War features endpapers showing dispatches and photos taken during the war.</p><p>On July 7, 1941, a young Colgate University football player named Andy Rooney reported for U.S. Army training. He was, Rooney allows, not prime military material. He had a knack for enraging the drill instructors with his wisecracks, and for pulling harsh assignments as a result, and his shenanigans got him disqualified from officer candidacy. Still, Rooney survived boot camp and served for a time as an artilleryman until being reassigned to the daily newspaper <i>Stars and Stripes</i>. Lucky for him, too: in 1942 his old outfit ran into trouble in North Africa, fighting against Erwin Rommel, and although few of them were killed, Rooney writes, "there's a good possibility I would have spent all of 1943, 1944, and six months of 1945 in a German prison camp."<p> In <i>My War</i>, a fine and wholeheartedly irreverent memoir, Rooney--later to gain fame as a <i>60 Minutes</i> commentator--recounts what happened instead. As a correspondent, he saw combat up-close while honing his craft alongside such fellow chroniclers as Ernie Pyle and Bill Mauldin. What he witnessed will perhaps not please some survivors and students of the war, especially those who revere Gen. George S. Patton--whom Rooney charges with having committed improprieties, injustices, and even war crimes in the quest to secure personal fame.</p><p> Though the book is a personal memoir, Rooney has taken pains to square his anecdotes with the historical record. However, he writes, "It is distressing for me to note how infrequently the facts concur with my memory of what happened." (In such cases, he adds, he assumes that the facts are wrong.) Affecting, occasionally disturbing, and thoroughly well-written, Rooney's memoir is a welcome addition to the literature of "the good war." <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Andy Rooney is a nationally syndicated columnist and a regular commentator on 60 Minutes. He is the author of numerous best-selling books, including Sincerely, Andy Rooney. He lives in Rowayton, Connecticut.</p><h2>100 Best Album Covers</h2><p>From the psychedelia of the Beatles&#39; Sgt.

No other album cover compilation comes close to 100 Best Album Covers in showing -- and telling -- the &#34;stories behind the sleeves.&#34; The ideal gift for music lovers of all ages.</p><p>The immediate question that arises with a book entitled <i>100 Best Album Covers</i> is, of course, "Says who?" Wisely, authors Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell have anticipated such widespread suspicion. In their thorough and amusing introduction, the two former cover designers (of Hipgnosis) go on at length about potentially qualifying factors (innovation, humor, bizarreness, minimalism, audacity) and possible reasons for nonselection (popularity, dull illustration, ugly technique, emotional offensiveness). But, they concede, what it really comes down to is a matter of taste--with a bit of nostalgia thrown into the mix.<p> In the end, the mysterious (and eternally debatable) selection formula matters not. The history, inspiration, and technical design details provided for each of the 100 covers that made the cut serve as reason enough for their inclusion. Did you know that Led Zeppelin's <i>Houses of the Holy</i> cover was inspired by Arthur C. Clarke's novel, <i>Childhood's End?</i>? Or that the burning man on Pink Floyd's <i>Wish You Were Here</i> was actually on fire (and in a bit of danger)? Or that an original idea for Supertramp's <i>Breakfast in America</i> was to depict cereal and milk rolling through the Grand Canyon? Tasty tidbits like these, along with quotes from designers, photographers, and the musicians themselves, make this a must-have volume for music fans--yes, even if your personal top 100 covers would constitute an entirely different collection. <i>--Brangien Davis</i></p>Together with co-author Aubrey Powell, Storm Thorgerson founded the influential 1960s Hipgnosis design studio. He is the creative genius behind some of rock music&#39;s best-known and most compelling album covers, including several classic Pink Floyd sleeves. Thorgerson has had five of his cover designs included in the 100 classic album covers chosen by the editors of Rolling Stone magazine.</p><h2>Star Trek Federation: The First 150 Years</h2><p>For the first time, an &#x2018;in universe&#x2019; history of <i>Star Trek</i>, complete with excerpts from Starfleet records and intergalactic intelligence, including James T.

Since its original publication, not only has homosexuality gradually become assimilated into American society, but the gay community has undergone a great transformation as a result of the AIDS epidemic. These changes are reflected in <i>The New Joy of Gay Sex,</i>an essential reference book for every gay man.<p></p>Dr. Charles Silverstein, a noted psychologist who has worked with gay men for more than two decades and coauthor of <i>The Joy of Gay Sex,</i>has collaborated with critically acclaimed novelist Felice Picano on this revised edition. Invaluable as a resource, in building self-esteem, and as a coming-out guide for young gay men, <i>The New Joy of Gay Sex</i>updates all the entries of its predecessor and includes many new ones. The book has three goals: to educate gay men about safe sex and save lives by showing the varieties of sexual behavior still available; to address the many emotional and relationship-oriented issues that arise in gay life, such as long-term couples, one-night stands, loneliness, and growing older; and to serve as a general home reference on a number of diverse topics, from living wills to a short history of condoms.<p></p>With eight color paintings and fifty line drawings by noted illustrators Deni Ponty and Ron Fowler, <i>The New Joy of Gay Sex</i>is a necessary addition to every gay man's bookshelf.<p></p></p><p>Charles Silverstein is a clinical psychologist and psychotherapist who practices in New York City.<p></p>As the authors suggest in their introduction, some readers, gay and straight, will be offended by this book's nonjudgmental, even accepting attitude toward "the kinkier aspects of erotic life." These activities include sex with animals, sadomasochism and "intergenerational love affairs" such as the relationship between an 11-year-old boy and a 21-year-old man. These repugnant sections of this revised edition of a 1977 guide to male/male relationships mar an otherwise useful volume, with new and updated entries reflecting the AIDS crisis, safe-sex practices and the upsurge of gay political activism. An uninhibited, no-holds-barred sex manual illustrated with 60 explicit line drawings and eight pages of color paintings, the book is also intended as a guide to coming out for closeted gay men. The alphabetically arranged entries conversationally urge readers to delve into psychosocial aspects of gay life and to explore such topics as body image, fidelity, homophobia, jealousy, parents and racism in the gay community. Silverstein, a clinical psychologist, coauthored the original edition with Edmund White. Picano ( The Lure ) is a novelist. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Who Will Teach the Wisdom</h2><p>Who Will Teach the Wisdom is a compelling account of the authors recent involvement preparing a small Special Operations team for a mission to Africa to eradicate a group of insurgents. The narrative begins in a remote jungle training camp deep within a remote rain forest in Puerto Rico, but has as its source the wisdom of Africa. There are no easy missions but this Special Forces mission was successful because it was a mission carried out in Africa using the wisdom of Africa as its Genesis. More important, unlike most previous counter-insurgency operations, no more insurgents succeeded in gaining a foothold in the tribal area in which the mission was carried out. This was because the same wisdom that was used in finding the insurgents was used in eradicating them. This is also a book about the authors journey back to Africa in search of the wisdom needed to ensure the success of the Special Operations mission. It is a search in which he unlocks for readers the fascinating mystery of what enabled the famed Selous Scouts, a Special Operations unit in which the author served for many years, to terrorize the terrorists to such an extent that they were too afraid even to mention the unit s name. They referred to its soldiers simply as skuz-apo, or those who have stolen our identity. Of greater interest, the author reveals the crucial role played by the tribes in the units astonishing success. Readers can accompany the author during the countless days and nights he spent huddled around cooking fires in the company of tribal elders in the uncompromising remoteness of the African bush trying to unlock the puzzle of how to gain the tribal support needed to win the Rhodesian bush war.</p><p>Timothy Bax was born in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanganyika, in 1949. He attended boarding school in Lushoto from the age of six and in 1963 moved to England to continue his schooling. A year later he moved with his mother and two sisters to Toronto, Canada, where he completed his education. At the age of nineteen, Tim returned alone to Africa, living first in South Africa then in Rhodesia (Zimbabwe). He was commissioned into the Rhodesian Army as a lieutenant in 1972, serving first with the Rhodesian Light Infantry then with the elite Selous Scouts Regiment. It was while serving with that unconventional unit that Tim spent many years living and working amongst the tribes in remote areas of Rhodesia and Mozambique. He was married to his wife, Carol in 1977. Their daughter, Jennifer, was born in June, 1982. Tim is currently resident in the United States where he lectures on African customs and assists conducting survival training courses from a remote jungle facility in the Caribbean.I have just received five copies of the book Who Will Teach the Wisdom which I ordered two weeks ago. I read the book through in just over a day (in between work) and simply could not put it down! I intend reading it a second time in case I missed anything. What a wonderful literary work the author has produced. It s a poignant story relevant to all who went through the Rhodesian conflict or who have any interest in it. The book is of enormous historical significance too as it gives readers a keen appreciation of the work carried out by the Selous Scouts of which the author was an active member. It was, for us helicopter pilots, an absolute privilege and honour to fly exceptional soldiers such as the author in and out of battle. The other four copies of the book I ordered are for my other colleges and close friends who pulled collective pitch with sticks of brave Rhodesian soldiers. --Mark Aitchison<br><br>I served with a TIER 1 Special Operations unit for twelve years and wish I had read this book while I was still serving. It should be required reading for every soldier deployed on a foreign battlefield, especially those being deployed to Africa. I do not know the author but salute him for having both the courage and the guts to write about what we soldiers have been doing wrong for so long and we need to do to get it right. --Dan Goddard.</p><h2>Keep It Simple: The Early Design Years of Apple</h2><p>�The true design story behind the evolution of Apple computers <br>�An inspiring collaboration of Steve Jobs and author Hartmut Esslinger <br>�380 illustrations that takes a step by step view of the most famous brand that&#x2019;s still a dominating force today <br><br>Keep it Simple is the authentic story of the collaboration between Steve Jobs and Hartmut Esslinger, which began in 1982.

Barr, Jr: Missionary for the Modern</h2><p>Dust jacket notes: &#34;On May 10, 1939, when the museum of Modern Art celebrated the opening of its handsome new home on Manhattan&#39;s West Fifty-third Street, it signaled the triumph of modern art and its foremost missionary and defender, Alfred H. Barr, Jr. Now, on the fiftieth anniversary of that opening, Alice Goldfarb Marquis offers a superlatively entertaining account of MOMA&#39;s first director and guiding genius, who transformed a three-room exhibition gallery into a world-famous museum -- and in the process became perhaps the single most powerful influence in the creation of today&#39;s art establishment. Handpicked by Abby Aldrich Rockefeller to head a fledgling museum dedicated to the controversial art of the twentieth century, Alfred Barr seemed an unlikely choice. The frail, bespectacled art professor from Wellesley, the son of a Presbyterian minister, was virtually unknown, had no administrative experience, and could hardly be expected to deal successfully in the rapacious, tightly interconnected arena of the international art market. But young Barr proved astonishingly capable, quickly establishing a network of contacts among artists, dealers, influential critics, wealthy patrons, and potential donors. Though limited by a minuscule buying budget, Barr had an unfailing eye for excellence and an unexpected talent for haggling, enabling him to acquire for MOMA the world&#39;s finest collection of modern art -- a catalog of masterpieces now valued in the tens of millions of dollars. Mondrian, Rousseau, Braque, Klee, Rodin, Moore, Giacometti, Arp, Picasso, Rothko, Pollock -- Barr&#39;s wide-ranging taste encompassed them all. And his carefully planned exhibitions and explanatory notes made them understandable to millions of MOMA&#39;s visitors. Nor was Barr&#39;s interest limited to the &#39;fine arts.&#39; Under his direction the museum brought aesthetic standards to the materials of everyday life....&#34;</p><p>Son of a Presbyterian minister from Baltimore, Barr preached the gospel of modern art with missionary zeal. Enlisted by the Rockefellers to become first director of New York's Museum of Modern Art, he helped make Picasso, Klee, Mondrian and Matisse household names here. In this superb, vivid, dynamic biography, one of America's most powerful tastemakers comes across as a sloppy administrator, an insomniac plagued by money and health problems, an urbane flatterer who could be maddeningly evasive or tactless and who often squandered his energies on trivial issues. Gangling, bookish Barr, who died in 1981, was an unlikely reformer, and Marquis, a historian at UC San Diego, shows that once his revolution in taste took hold, Barr became extremely wary of philistinism and new trends, resisting abstract expressionism. This juicy chronicle captures a whirl of museum and art-world politics rarely glimpsed by the public. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.When Barr became the first director of the Museum of Modern Art in 1929, he was also its sole employee. As administrator, art historian, and shaper of MOMA's collection over the next 52 years, Barr influenced not only the museum's history but the development and acceptance of modern art in this country. Through his acquisitions, exhibits, and books, he zealously campaigned against a public who condemned modern art after "ten seconds of casual, prejudiced study." This first full-length biography of one of modernism's most influential taste makers shows how he conceived and built the institution that, more than any other, has influenced the visual culture of our time.<br><i>- Russell T.

Original.</p><p><b>Q&amp;A with &#x201c;New York Times&#x201d; Best-Selling Author Max Allan Collins</b> <p> Max Allan Collins is the Shamus Award winning, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>Road to Perdition</i> and multiple award-winning novels, screenplays, comic books, comic strips, trading cards, short stories, movie novelizations, and historical fiction. We recently had the chance to ask him a few questions about his Disaster Series.</p> <p><b>Question:</b> It&#x2019;s unusual for a series of mystery novels to lack a continuing character; however this series is based on a thematic unity. You focus not only on famous historical disasters, but also on a succession of famous mystery and thriller writers, as your hero/detectives. How did you come up with that approach?</p> <p><b>Max Allan Collins:</b> Somewhat by accident. As with most of my series books, this one spun off of a novel intended as a one-shot <i>The Titanic Murders</i>. Shortly after I saw James Cameron&#x2019;s film, I was talking to an editor at Berkley Books about the movie, and its enormous popularity, and mentioned in an off-hand way that a famous mystery writer of the era had died on the Titanic, Jacques Futrelle, author of the <i>Thinking Machine stories</i>, which I&#x2019;d read in junior high. I said, off the top of my hand, that somebody should write a mystery in which Jacques Futrelle solves a closed-environment, Agatha Christie-style puzzle aboard the doomed ship. Wouldn&#x2019;t it be darkly amusing for the detective to solve a murder mystery, pronounce all right with the world, and then hear a WHUMP, and say, &#x201c;What was that?&#x201d; And then after a long pause, my editor said, &#x201c;Can you get me something this afternoon? Just a paragraph?&#x201d; I said sure, did so, and the book was sold. Same day. </p> <p> <b>Q:</b> But how did <i>The Titanic Murders</i> lead to a series? </p> <p> <b>MAC:</b> When it came time to negotiate the contract, I was told that the publisher wasn&#x2019;t taking on anything but series books &#x2013; and that I had to come up with two more books. I said, &#x201c;Well, the detective dies at the end &#x2013; it is the Titanic, after all.&#x201d; Too bad, but you have to do a series, I was told. Again, off the top of my head, I said, well, I could do other famous disasters, like the Hindenburg and the Lusitania. </p> <p> <b>Q:</b> But not all of the writers were actually present when the disaster in the novel took place, correct? </p> <p> <b>MAC:</b> Most were. Agatha Christie was certainly in London for the Blitz. Edgar Rice Burroughs was in Pearl Harbor during the attack. S.S. Van Dine did travel on the Lusitania, although not during the fateful voyage. And Walter Gibson, as the creator of the Shadow, had an obvious connection to Orson Welles, making Gibson&#x2019;s presence at the &#x201c;War of the Worlds&#x201d; broadcast believable. </p> <p> <b>Q:</b> Will there be more Disaster novels? </p> <p> <b>MAC:</b> Well, I always say it&#x2019;s nice to write a novel that&#x2019;s a disaster on purpose. But during the writing of <em>The Lusitania Murders</em>, 9/11, the worst disaster of recent memory, occurred and took some of the fun out of my notion. I never made light of the disasters I was dealing with, except perhaps in <em>The War of the Worlds Murder</em>. But the distance of time does provide a cushion. I&#x2019;ll be interested to see how new readers, coming to the Thomas &amp; Mercer editions, feel. </p> <p> <b>Q:</b> We understand all of the books will be available on audio. </p> <p> <b>MAC:</b> Yes, most of them for the first time. It&#x2019;s fun to have these stories, these characters, come so vividly to life. </p>Max Allan Collins is the New York Times bestselling author of Road to Perdition and multiple award-winning novels, screenplays, comic books, comic strips, trading cards, short stories, movie novelizations, and historical fiction.

This information is vital to drivers of large vehicles such as trucks and recreational vehicles. If you have ever lost your brakes while descending a mountain, you will understand how important it is to know ahead of time what the mountain grades are like. With this information, you can either plan a different route, or at least be prepared for the grades that you must climb and descend. This book tells how long the grades are, how steep (%) they are, whether the roads are two, three, or four lane, if they have switchbacks, sharp curves, narrow shoulders, sharp dropoffs, escape ramps, etc. <p>This is the fourth edition of the western book and it includes 150 new pass and grade locations (for a total of 400 in the western states.) In addition, all of the black and white maps have been replaced with color relief maps. </p><p>There is a companion book, "Mountain Directory East for Truckers, RV, and Motorhome Drivers" which gives similar information but covers the mountainous areas in eleven eastern states. The eastern book includes locations and descriptions of over 300 mountain passes and steep grades. It too is a new edition with color relief maps. </p><p>Together, the two books give locations and descriptions of over 700 mountain passes and steep grades in 22 states. Almost 30,000 copies have been sold.</p></p><p>Author Richard Miller was inspired to write this book after a nearly disastrous mountain descent in an 18 wheeler. This occurred in Arizona, but when he subsequently attempted to find information about the mountain grades in various western states, he was amazed to learn that no one had compiled much data about these potentially deadly hills.

He is also the author of <i>Ken Jennings&#x2019;s Trivia Almanac</i>.&nbsp;Jennings lives in Washington with his wife Mindy, his son Dylan and daughter Caitlin, and a deeply unstable Labrador retriever named Banjo.Preface<br><br>I was sitting in my parents&#x2019; kitchen not long ago when my young son, Dylan, came whipping around the corner with a grape Tootsie Pop firmly clamped in his teeth.<br> <br>&#x201c;Whoa, slow down!&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;What if you tripped and fell on your face? The lollipop stick would get jammed right through the roof of your mouth!&#x201d;<br> <br>Dylan&#x2019;s eyes got wide. &#x201c;Could that <i>really</i> happen?&#x201d;<br> <br>I had to admit, I had no idea. This was something my mother had told me repeatedly while I was growing up, but it&#x2019;s not like I&#x2019;d ever dug into the relevant medical literature or consulted with surgeons. What do you do when a nine-year-old calls your bluff?<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course it&#x2019;s true!&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;Go sit down at the table until you&#x2019;re done with your lollipop.&#x201d; Just like with terrorists and bears! You can&#x2019;t show any doubt or weakness!<br> <br>I found my mom and asked her to back me up: it&#x2019;s true about lollipop sticks and horrific puncture wounds, right? She had no idea. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what Grandma used to tell us,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I think it also happens in a Chaim Potok novel. <i>The Chosen,</i> maybe?&#x201d;<br> <br>I was horrified. A fact I&#x2019;d confidently passed along to my trusting children turned out to be thirdhand rumor confirmed only by a <i>novelist</i>? (A novelist-slash-rabbi, but still. And it turns out the lollipop injury isn&#x2019;t in <i>The Chosen,</i> anyway. It&#x2019;s from <i>In the Beginning</i>.) What else had I been inadvertently misleading them about? Washing behind their ears? Chewing with their mouths closed? Was our whole life together <i>a huge lie</i>?<br> <br>That&#x2019;s the dirty secret of parenting: it&#x2019;s a big game of Telephone stretching back through the centuries and delivering garbled, well-intended medieval bromides to the present. Possible misinformation like the lollipop thing never gets corrected; it just goes into hibernation for a few decades and then jumps out to snare a new generation, like a seventeen-year cicada. Parents find themselves in these factual blind alleys because they have no other resource than the dimly remembered thirty-year-old lectures of their own childhoods.<br> <br>Until now! In this book, I&#x2019;ve compiled 125 of the nagging Mom- and Dad-isms that we all grew up with, and then I&#x2019;ve meticulously researched the scientific evidence behind them. On some, I&#x2019;m happy to deliver a clear-cut verdict one way or another: either confirming them as &#x201c;True&#x201d; or debunking them as &#x201c;False.&#x201d; More often, though, the truth falls somewhere in between: true with an &#x201c;if,&#x201d; false with a &#x201c;but.&#x201d; Some of these parental clich�s turn out to be accidentally right for the wrong reason (see &#x201c;Eat your crusts, that&#x2019;s where the vitamins are!&#x201d; on page 90 or &#x201c;Never wake a sleepwalker!&#x201d; on page 165). Others are time-tested and unimpeachably sensible . . . but still don&#x2019;t always hold up well in real life (see &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t talk to strangers!&#x201d; on page 57). So there are plenty of &#x201c;Mostly False&#x201d; and &#x201c;Possibly True&#x201d; verdicts in here as well.<br> <br>Much of the gray area is a matter of risk assessment. Human beings, as a rule, are terrible students of probability. As a result, we develop paranoid, nightmare-inducing phobias about the unlikeliest things (plane crashes, strangers kidnapping our kids) while ignoring far more pressing risks (heart disease, car accidents). I&#x2019;ve used the best statistics available to try to help you gauge the relative risks of different childhood activities, whether that&#x2019;s going outside barefoot or swallowing gum or running with scissors, but the final decision is always going to be a judgment call&#x2014;like so many other elements of parenting, an art and not a science.<br> <br>Take my mom&#x2019;s lollipop fear, for example. There is a fair bit of medical research on &#x201c;pediatric oropharyngeal trauma,&#x201d; which is what doctors call it when kids bash up their mouths on some foreign object. A 2006 study out of Edmonton estimated that fully 1 percent of childhood injuries are oropharyngeal traumas, and another study from Pittsburgh&#x2019;s Children&#x2019;s Hospital found that puncture wounds were indeed common outcomes. Twenty-nine percent of the injuries were serious: a large laceration, or a fistula (eww) or mucosal flap (don&#x2019;t know what that is, but double eww). Brain damage and death are extremely rare complications, but both have happened.<br> <br>So clearly I was justified in telling my son to sit down while finishing his lollipop, right? Well, maybe and maybe not. The Pittsburgh study also notes that most cases are minor and heal with no medical intervention at all, and then runs down the items that are most likely to cause this kind of trauma. Lollipops were one of the rarest culprits, causing less than 3 percent of the injuries studied and vastly outnumbered by pencils, musical instruments, toys, sticks, and so on. The hospital treated just one lollipop case every two years, on average. Meanwhile, the Tootsie Pop company alone makes twenty million lollipops <i>per day</i>. I guarantee that lots of those lollipops get eaten by kids on the go&#x2014;and yet injuries are rare. So the numbers suggest that, compared to lots of other common day-to-day activities, eating-a-lollipop-not-sitting-down isn&#x2019;t terribly reckless. There&#x2019;s a fine line between making kids cautious about dangerous horseplay and just making them panicky about totally normal stuff, like moving around with a pencil or harmonica or something in their mouths.<br> <br>Parents love their kids, of course, and would like to keep them safe from everything. But even if that were an achievable goal&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s not&#x2014;it might not be great in the long run for the poor kids involved. A 2009 <i>Time</i> magazine cover package on &#x201c;helicopter parents&#x201d; followed the first wave of hypercushioned, overparented American children into adulthood, and the results were depressing: mommy webcams in college dorms, employers like Ernst &amp; Young preparing &#x201c;parent packets&#x201d; for the pushy parents of new twentysomething hires. By trying to protect our kids from every little thing, we may have created a generation of kids and young adults who don&#x2019;t feel confident about <i>anything</i>. So the risks need to be measured against the rewards. What if there&#x2019;s a 0.95 percent chance that a kid who bikes to school will get in a wreck, but a 95 percent chance that a kid who&#x2019;s <i>not</i> allowed to bike to school will grow up more tentative, complacent, lazy, and/or unhappy, because riding your bike to school is awesome? I feel like those percentages might not be that far off.<br> <br>So I hope this book serves as a reality check for potentially jittery parents. But even if you don&#x2019;t have kids right now, you presumably were (or even are) one yourself. In that case, I hope this book helps inoculate you against the crazy things parents somehow still believe&#x2014;and when you take away the authoritative intonation, <i>lots</i> of parental wisdom is pretty nuts. Put butter on a burn? Wear a hat if your feet are cold? Drink <i>eight</i> glasses of water a day? Is that even possible?<br> <br>If you really want to know how silly much of our parental nagging sounds, ask someone from a different culture what parents harp on there. My Korean friends weren&#x2019;t allowed to sleep with an electric fan in their rooms, because a fan, they were told, would somehow asphyxiate them while they slept. In Russia, kids are warned not to sit on cold surfaces, or they&#x2019;ll freeze their gonads and wind up sterile. Germans and Czechs hear from a young age that they should never drink water after eating fruit, or they&#x2019;ll get a bellyache. Filipino children don&#x2019;t get to wear red when it&#x2019;s stormy, because red clothing attracts lightning. A friend&#x2019;s Iranian mother used to warn her against ever inhaling a cat hair. If you get one caught in your throat, she said, you&#x2019;ll just keep vomiting repeatedly <i>until you die</i>. I&#x2019;m not poking fun at these superstitions&#x2014;I just want you to realize how ridiculous our own old wives&#x2019; tales would sound to someone who&#x2019;s never heard them before. Wait an hour after eating to swim? If you cross your eyes, they might stay that way? How, an outsider might wonder, does anyone actually believe this stuff ?<br> <br>And yet there are times when the oddest and the oldest bits of parental folklore turn out to be true. There are now studies showing that cold, wet feet might indeed help cause a cold and that chicken soup can fight one. Double-dipping potato chips does spread germs. Breakfast really is the most important meal of the day. Occasionally, Mom knew what she was talking about.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve intentionally limited this book to propositions that can easily be tested scientifically, by doctors and statisticians and so forth. I&#x2019;ve tried to back away slowly from vaguer points of parental philosophy: minefields like homeschooling, circumcision, co-sleeping, TV banning. Anything your weird sister-in-law is always talking about on Facebook is out, basically. Sadly, I also had to avoid areas where the science is still hotly debated and inconclusive, which meant leaving out a lot of very modern parental worries: video games and social media and whatnot. In twenty years, maybe I can write a sequel in which we finally find out what was up with phthalates in plastic toys, predators on the Internet, and cell phones causing cancer. But I&#x2019;m not sure how long that will take&#x2014;TV is over sixty years old and experts <i>still</i> disagree on how that affects kids. So don&#x2019;t hold your breath. (Holding your breath for too long <i>is</i> bad for you, according to a broad scientific consensus.)<br> <br>I know there&#x2019;s no way one book can stamp out <i>all</i> the lies parents tell their kids. You&#x2019;re still going to have safety lies (&#x201c;The car won&#x2019;t run unless your seat belts are on!&#x201d;) and cheapskate lies (&#x201c;Honey, when the ice cream man is playing music, it means his truck is all out of ice cream&#x201d;) and sympathy lies (&#x201c;We sent your hamster to live on a farm&#x201d;) and keep-your-kids-out-of-therapy lies (&#x201c;We love you both exactly the same!&#x201d;). But the <i>accidental</i> lies should be easier to tackle. It&#x2019;s time to shine the cold, hard light of truth onto controversial behaviors like sitting too close to the TV, eating toothpaste, and sneezing with your eyes open.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s not too late!

An expanded introduction by the editors looks at the history of folk and fairy tales and distinguishes between the genres, while revised introductions to individual sections provide more detailed history of particular tellers and tales, paying increased attention to the background and cultural origin of each tale.

They use fourfold approach: multiple versions of widely-attested tale types introduce the student to cross-cultural comparison; an examination of common themes introduces the role of tales in pedagogy and socialization; the juxtaposition of seemingly disparate tales demonstrates structural similarities (an approach new to this edition); and a survey of criticism provides other perspectives. The versions chosen underscore the pervasiveness of these masterpieces of the oral tradition in Western literature, yet also show that they are not the exclusive domain of the West but a world literature in its truest sense.&#x201d; &#x2015; <strong>Ian Brodie, Cape Breton University</strong> </p><br><br><p> &#x201c;This collection simultaneously gives readers a thorough introduction to the folk and fairy tale canon and challenges us to rethink that canon by including non-Western variants and postmodern retellings of classic tales, illustrations, and critical essays that enrich and diversify our sense of the field.

More household-management manual than cookbook, the book does contain recipes for making beer and punch, salad sauce, mustard, currant jam, syrups, and fruit-flavored waters of all kinds. There are directions for carving, marketing, choosing meats, fish and poultry, and preserving, and how to complete household chores successfully, clean everything in the house, behave properly, and prepare and serve food for family dinners and parties of all sizes. The book has suggestions for employers on how to manage domestic help (very unusual for the time), but Roberts was more interested in teaching young black men how to succeed in their work and ensure their advancement.<br><br>This edition of <i>The House Servant&#x2019;s Directory </i>was reproduced by permission from the volume in the collection of the American Antiquarian Society, Worcester, Massachusetts.

An investigator for a Florida-based Death Row defense firm, Novak's life derailed when his wife, Lauren, was killed in the midst of a case the two were working together. Two years later, her murderer is still at large, and Novak's attempts to learn the truth about her death through less-than-legal means and jailhouse bargaining have put his job on the line. Now he's been all but banished, sent to Garrison, Indiana to assess a cold case that he's certain his boss has no intention of taking. <br> As Novak knows all too well, some crimes never do get solved. But it's not often that the man who many believe got away with murder is the one calling for the case to be reopened. Ten years ago, a teenaged girl disappeared inside an elaborate cave system beneath rural farmland. Days later, Ridley Barnes emerged carrying Sarah Martin's lifeless body. Barnes has claimed all along that he has no memory of exactly where -- or how -- he found Sarah. His memory of whether she was dead or alive at the time is equally foggy. Tired of living under a cloud of suspicion, he says he wants answers -- even if they mean he'll end up in the electric chair. <br><br> But what's he really up to? And Novak knows why he's so unhappy to be in Garrison - but why are the locals so hostile towards him? The answers lie in the fiendish brain of a dangerous man, the real identity of a mysterious woman, and deep beneath them all, in the network of ancient, stony passages that hold secrets deadlier than he can imagine. Soon Novak is made painfully aware that if he has any chance of returning to the life and career he left behind in Florida, he'll need to find the truth in Garrison first.<br><br></p><p><b>Michael Koryta</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of fourteen novels, most recently <i>If She Wakes</i>.

They match the folksy spirit of the text, although characters lack detailed facial expressions. This new yarn will entertain followers of the frontier pair, and it should tantalize them to try the more complex tall tales of Pecos Bill and Paul Bunyan. Charlene Strickland, Los Angeles County Public Library, Valencia, Calif.<br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.That wacky Texas couple, Shirley and Claude, establishes that they are kindred spirits in this rollicking prequel to If You Say So, Claude and Beats Me, Claude. In the frontier town of Hideyhole, feisty Shirley resists her parents' attempts to marry her offespecially since the only bachelor left is dull Elmer Twaddle. She'd rather go to Colorado to look for gold. On the trail she meets Claude, whose mama's marriage to a widower gives him a sudden hankering for prospecting, too (if he'd stuck around, he'd have to support his new stepfather's six young sons). Shirley and Claude help each other through thick and thinuntil they both spot gold on the same site. In crisp, sure language laced with delightfully outrageous exaggeration, Nixon has spun a rib-tickling yarn with an underlying message about the value of friendship. Pearson's spirited illustrations double the hilarity and silly good fun: the picture of Claude proposing is worth a pan of gold.

As an adult, he said that he felt he had escaped an appointment with death. He made it his life's work to see that others could do the same. Born into the life of a Montana chicken farmer, Hilleman ran off to the University of Chicago to become a microbiologist, and eventually joined Merck, the pharmaceutical company, to pursue his goal of eliminating childhood disease. Chief among his accomplishments are nine vaccines that practically every child gets, rendering formerly dread diseases&#x2014;including often devastating ones such as mumps and rubella&#x2014;practically toothless and nearly forgotten; his measles vaccine alone saves several million lives every year. </p><p><em>Vaccinated</em> is not a biography; Hilleman's experience forms the basis for a rich and lively narrative of two hundred years of medical history, ranging across the globe and throughout time to take in a cast of hundreds, all caught up, intentionally or otherwise, in the story of vaccines. It is an inspiring and triumphant tale, but one with a cautionary aspect, as vaccines come under assault from people blaming vaccines for autism and worse. Paul Offit clearly and compellingly rebuts those arguments, and, by demonstrating how much the work of Hilleman and others has gained for humanity, shows us how much we have to lose. </p></p><p><p>Paul A. Offit, MD, is chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases and director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, as well as the acclaimed author of <em>Autism's False Prophets</em>, <em>Vaccinated</em>, and <em>Deadly Choices</em>.</p>*Starred Review* Maurice Hilleman's name isn't well known, and according to infectious disease expert Offit's riveting biography, that is both a shame and a blessing. It's a shame because the outspoken, brilliant, yet humble scientist from Montana invented vaccines that all but wiped out a number of infectious diseases. Thanks to his genius, such diseases as mumps, rubella, measles, and hepatitis A and B no longer claim millions of lives, mostly children's. He merits greater recognition. His obscurity is a blessing because it prevents more people from using his name in vain, for Hilleman's vaccines have recently become increasingly controversial and their efficacy clouded by questions about adverse side effects. Still, Offit pulls no punches in defending Hilleman against those who would crucify him for combining measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines into one shot and for the choice to add thimerosal to extend the shelf life of all vaccines. Despite the fact that Offit's bias on behalf of public health shows, the book is a powerful examination of the kind of single-minded determination it takes to tackle diseases that threaten the world's children. And to do so without bravado&#x2014;no vaccine bears Hilleman's name, no awards his mantle&#x2014;is to define what it is to be simply heroic.

In this biography of Horatio Nelson, Ernle Bradford discusses Nelson&#39;s own battles, but also looks at naval warfare of the period in general. The author describes the strategies, the tactics, the ponderous ship-to-ship bombardments, the terrifying injuries, as well as Nelson&#39;s policy of annihilation of the opposing fleet, making the point that Nelson regarded the escape of a single enemy ship as a failure.</p><p>12 1.5-hour cassettesErnle Bradford was born in 1922 and died in 1986.

In the 17th century, a young Italian scholar sailing from Venice to Naples is taken prisoner and delivered to Constantinople There he falls into the custody of a scholar known as Hoja--&#34;master&#34;--a man who is his exact double. In the years that follow, the slave instructs his master in Western science and technology, from medicine to pyrotechnics. But Hoja wants to know more: why he and his captive are the persons they are and whether, given knowledge of each other&#39;s most intimate secrets, they could actually exchange identities. Set in a world of magnificent scholarship and terrifying savagery, The White Castle is a colorful and intricately patterned triumph of the imagination.

Arena Editions, 1999. ISBN 1892041162</p><p>Mapplethorpe, whose name is now synonymous with controversy, was renowned for his refined aesthetic and his willingness to confront taboos. In contrast to his classical portraits, nudes, and still lifes, his sex photographs and the reactions they engendered have been much discussed but less frequently seen. Edited and designed by Levas, this compilation of images (made between 1976 and 1980) showcases 103 beautifully reproduced duotone plates and demonstrates Mapplethorpe's intimate, personal vision of homosexuality and fetishism. Interview editor Ingrid Sischy provides a brief introductory essay that concisely contextualizes the work, explaining that while they may be shocking the photos are not pornographic. "Explicit pictures of homosexual sex don't make up a huge proportion of his work, but they are its underbelly." This handsome book is a welcome addition to the 100 books and articles listed in its bibliography, offering valuable documentation of an important artist.

All that's needed to recreate the effect in the garden are a sharp pair of pruners, some imagination, and the instruction found in <i>The Art of Creative Pruning</i>. Drawing on both eastern and western styles, author Jake Hobson moves beyond the traditional lollipops and animals and teaches a wholly new approach to ornamental pruning that appeals to modern sensibilities. </p><p>Picture boxwoods trimmed into whimsical Russian nesting dolls, hedges inscribed with words, and a tree snipped to resemble the toppling tiers of a wedding cake. These are just a few of the unusual ideas featured in the beautifully photographed pages.

He spent a year at a nursery in Osaka, and in 2004 started his own business&#x2014;Niwaki, which distributes&nbsp;Japanese garden tools. A keen observer of the artistry of gardens, Hobson recieved his bachelor's degree in sculpture. He lives in the UK.<b>Preface: On Rock and Roll, Pruning and Love</b><br> I once read an article about the musician Lou Reed, who was looking back on his Velvet Underground days. I remember reading that he still gets a buzz every time he turns on his amplifier and feels the hum of electricity flow through his guitar. This made quite an impression on me&#x2014;since the beginning of his musical career, Lou has probably turned on his amp most days, and it was inspiring to read that each time he does, he feels the same excitement, the same potential of what the day might bring, as he did when he was a teenager.<br><br> Granted, pruning is not quite rock and roll, but I get a similar feeling to that guitar amp buzz that Lou described every time I reach for my pruning tools at the beginning of the day. The anticipation of the damp morning dew soaking my shirt sleeves, the sweet smell of fresh box, or boxwood, clippings, the sun&#x2014;or rain&#x2014;on my back and the satisfying first clip of the day through to the inevitable aches and blisters that will arrive later that evening.<br><br> I love the physical action of pruning, in all its manifestations. I love climbing up ladders and chopping things down. I love the quick jobs that only take five minutes but achieve so much, and the satisfied feeling at the end of a demanding job well done. Most of all I love the results: the effect that a few deliberate cuts, or years and years of gradual teasing can have, not just on a plant, but the whole garden. I love the way pruning can create landscapes, evoke far off places and memories and how it can surprise and even shock, focusing and distracting viewers by turns. I love its solidity and permanence, but also its fragility and the grey area it occupies between man and nature, gardener and garden.<br><br> What qualifies as creative topiary or decorative pruning? Anything really, when approached from the right direction and with the right mindset, but I get particularly excited by interesting forms, ambitious scale, unusual plant types (not so much exotic as unexpected) surprising contexts, breathtaking locations, visible enthusiasm on the part of the owner or creator and a generally vibrant atmosphere. Gardens in Provence, France, tend to score heavily when it comes to location&#x2014;Gourdon, hanging onto a cliff face suspended over a rocky valley, is one such spectacular example, while the Keage water treatment plant in Kyoto, Japan, although clearly not the most glamorous place in the world, does have the most amazing repetition of azalea blobs planted on its banks, the sheer weight of numbers there achieving a look that more sophisticated gardens could not.<br> &nbsp;<br> Where do I draw the line? There is no room in this book for animal topiary&#x2014;no teddy bears or squirrels allowed, although since writing this, I have noticed that one or two examples seem to have somehow crept in. If that upsets you, write your own book. On the other hand, although pruning itself is not weighed down with creative potential, I rank agricultural hedge flailing&#x2014;the cutting of farmland hedgerows by tractors armed with lethal flailing chains as practised in the UK&#x2014;as a highly sculptural process that is fully worthy of inclusion in this book. Some people disapprove of this method for environmental reasons, but the sight of a well-flailed hedge running across the countryside is as inspirational to me as any garden I have seen. If you still feel any doubt about the possibilities and potential of agricultural pruning, as opposed to horticultural pruning, look no further than the tea plantations in the Far East, where bizarre landscapes of tea cover entire valleys like limestone pavements.<br> &nbsp;<br> During the creation of this book, I have become much more aware of how interconnected the various genres of pruning I was thinking about actually are. When I began writing, I started off with a very clearly defined list of chapters and sub-sections. It soon became clear, however, that it was not chapters that were called for, but some sort of family tree, or a map of a river system with endless tributaries, flood plains, backwaters and oxbow lakes&#x2014;or even some vast web of interconnected strands. A Venn diagram of pruning turns into one large circle that encompasses everything and excludes nothing, so please forgive any apparently erratic subdivisions and understand the dilemmas I faced in writing this book. Eventually I settled on chapters covering topiary and shaping, cloud pruning and organic topiary, hedges, <i>niwaki </i>and Japanese-influenced pruning, decorative tree pruning and a slightly indulgent look at creative pruning.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>1969: The Year Everything Changed</h2><p>In 1969, man landed on the moon; the &#x201c;Miracle Mets&#x201d; captivated sports fans; students took over college campuses and demonstrators battled police; America witnessed the Woodstock music festival; Hollywood produced <i>Easy Rider</i>; Kurt Vonnegut published <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>; punk music was born; and there was murder at Altamont Speedway. Compelling, timely, and a blast to read, <i>1969</i> chronicles the year in culture and society, sports, music, film, politics, and technology.

His creative writing has been published by <i>Aethlon</i> and <i>Slow Trains</i>. He has published the books of many well-known authors.Lamenting all the attention 1968 has gotten with assassinations and riots, Kirkpatrick argues that the following year was more than a little&nbsp;significant,&nbsp;too. Beginning with a &#x201c;selected timeline,&#x201d; Kirkpatrick goes on to chronicle a dizzying array of major events: Richard Nixon&#x2019;s election in November 1968&nbsp;as president; the covert bombing of Cambodia; Apollo 11 landing on the moon; student antiwar protests from Harvard to Berkeley; disclosure of the My Lai massacre; the sexual revolution manifested on stage, in&nbsp;literature and&nbsp;movies, and at outdoor festivals; startling innovations in&nbsp;the music world;&nbsp;the &#x201c;days of rage&#x201d; protest kicked off during the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago; the first message sent via the ARPANET, precursor of the Internet. Kirkpatrick asserts that 1969 was the birth of modern America and sets out to relate how this incredible year reflected deep underlying changes in American culture. The book is divided into&nbsp;four parts that roughly outline the year, including&nbsp;&#x201c;sexual revolutions of springtime&#x201d; and &#x201c;the apocalyptic standoffs at year&#x2019;s end.&#x201d; A riveting look at a pivotal year. --Vanessa Bush</p><h2>Journeys and Explorations in the Cotton Kingdom: A Traveller&#39;s Observations on Cotton and Slavery in the American Slave States Based Upon Three Former Journeys and Investigations</h2><p>&#34;My own observation of the real condition of the people of our Slave States, gave me ... an impression that the cotton monopoly in some way did them more harm than good; and although the written narration of what I saw was not intended to set this forth, upon reviewing it for the present publication, I find the impression has become a conviction.&#34; He argued that slavery had made the slave states inefficient (a set amount of work took 4 times as long in Virginia as in the North) and backward both economically and socially.

Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison, and Pete Best were a close group of Liverpool friends, each dreaming to transcend their working-class backgrounds and affect the world with their music and artistic message. They came together in the late fifties, blasting the world with a new sound and a new consciousness, fully realizing their dream faster than even they could have imagined.<br>With the family's Kodak Box Brownie, Michael photographed instinctively and captured precious Beatles' moments on film. Paul's consistent request to Michael was, "Make me look famous," and Michael obliged, knowing intuitively that someday he and his subject would not have to pretend.<br>Now, for the first time, these rare photographs, some of which have never been seen before, are gathered here with Michael's eyewitness accounts of the early history of this phenomenal group, their roots and their dreams. The book opens with family snapshots of the McCartneys and their home, with its patched carpet and wallpaper, as well as scenes depicting the boys' sadness at their mother's early death. Lucky for us, Paul's refuge from grief was his guitar and Michael's was his camera.<br>Join Michael, Paul, and the other Beatles during the Liverpool days at the Cavern Club and the Tower Ballroom. Michael captures the boys' transition from amateur musicians to potential superstars at the hand of Brian Epstein, who directed them to give up their leather jackets and slicked hair for tailored suits and moptops and, more significantly, decreed the final performance of drummer Pete Best, ushering in Ringo Starr on white drums.<br>Paul's twenty-first birthday party; Paul and George's first cars; old girlfriends; secret wives; and the growing crowd - all these and more were the subjects of Michael's all-seeing camera. Photographs taken on the set of Help!; the boys with their favorite musicians (at first requesting to have their pictures taken with the stars, then the stars asking to be in pictures with them); Paul in his first press interview; John and Paul writing songs in the McCartney living room; street scenes and significant places in Liverpool, the city that shaped so much of the Beatle repertoire.<br>Do you remember?

After a brief fling in pro hockey, Vince, though good enough to have a real career, married and went back to the farm. Not Lou, who kept playing until his knee gave out. Eventually he wound up in Toronto, only going home after 25 years, when Mom died, and then not again until an accident left Vince crippled and widowed. When Vince died, that left Lou alone. As always, Lou thinks, also thinking he knows why: the night he made out with Vince's fianc�e definitely the reason Vince wouldn t have Lou coming back after Mom was buried. Lemire handles the stuff of a Willa Cather novel with equal poetry, though in images made of lines and spaces rather than words. He renders emotion and temperament in a cartoon face with breathtaking, masterful economy. He manages transitions between present and past and sequences of magic realism as deftly and hauntingly as Ingmar Bergman in Wild Strawberries and Orson Welles in Citizen Kane. Is it too soon to say that Lemire is a major graphic novelist? --Booklist (starred review)<br><br>Lemire's pen renders the town and farm land in the bleakest black and white, with lines that are like gashes in the characters' souls. Their pasts are reflected in their faces, craggy and broken like the earth they walk on -- it's a stylistic triumph of sequential illustration. --John E. Mitchell, North Adams (MA) Transcript<br><br>I just finished a great graphic novel called Ghost Stories by Jeff Lemire. I had tears in my eyes when I was done, and I really didn't expect it to take that kind of toll; after all, it's about an old man who used to be a hockey player.

There was once upon a time a piece of wood.<br>This wood was not valuable: it was only a common log like those that are burnt in winter in the stoves and fireplaces to make a cheerful blaze and warm the rooms.<br>I cannot say how it came about, but the fact is that one fine day this piece of wood was lying in the shop of an old carpenter of the name of Master Antonio. He was, however, called by everybody Master Cherry, on account of the end of his nose, which was always as red and polished as a ripe cherry.<br>No sooner had Master Cherry set eyes on the piece of wood than his face beamed with delight; and, rubbing his hands together with satisfaction, he said softly to himself:<br>"This wood has come at the right moment; it will just do to make the leg of a little table."<br>Having said this he immediately took a sharp ax with which to remove the bark and the rough surface. Just, however, as he was going to give the first stroke, he remained with his arm suspended in the air, for he heard a very small voice saying imploringly, "Do not strike me so hard!"<br>Picture to yourselves the astonishment of good old Master Cherry!<br>He turned his terrified eyes all round the room to try and discover where the little voice could possibly have come from, but he saw nobody! He looked under the bench--nobody; he looked into a cupboard that was always shut--nobody; he looked into a basket of shavings and sawdust--nobody; he even opened the door of the shop and gave a glance into the street--and still nobody. Who, then, could it be?<br>"I see how it is," he said, laughing and scratching his wig. "Evidently that little voice was all my imagination. Let us set to work again."<br>And taking up the ax, he struck a tremendous blow on the piece of wood.<br>"Oh! Oh! You have hurt me!" cried the same little voice dolefully.<br>This time Master Cherry was petrified. His eyes started out of his head with fright, his mouth remained open, and his tongue hung out almost to the end of his chin, like a mask on a fountain. As soon as he had recovered the use of his speech, he began to say, stuttering and trembling with fear.<br>"But where on earth can that little voice have come from that said Oh! Oh!? Here there is certainly no living soul. Is it possible that this piece of wood can have learnt to cry and to lament like a child? I cannot believe it. This piece of wood, here it is; a log for fuel like all the others, and thrown on the fire it would about suffice to boil a saucepan of beans...How then? Can anyone be hidden inside it? If anyone is hidden inside, so much, the worse for him. I will settle him at once."<br>So saying, he seized the poor piece of wood and commenced beating it without mercy against the walls of the room.<br>Then he stopped to listen if he could hear any little voice lamenting. He waited two minutes--nothing; five minutes--nothing; ten minutes--still nothing!<br>"I see how it is," he then said, forcing himself to laugh and pushing up his wig. "Evidently the little voice that said Oh! Oh! was all my imagination! Let us set to work again."<br>Nevertheless, he was very frightened, so he tried to sing to give himself a little courage.<br>Putting the ax aside, he took his plane, to plane and polish the bit of wood; but while he was running it up and down he heard the same little voice say laughing:<br>"Have done! You are tickling me all over!"<br>This time poor Master Cherry fell down as if he had been struck by lightning. When he at last opened his eyes he found himself seated on the floor.<br>His face was quite changed; even the end of his nose, instead of being crimson, as it was nearly always, had become blue from fright.<br>&nbsp;<br>Illustrations � 2002 by Gris Grimly</p><h2>Principles of Color: A Review of Past Traditions and Modern Theories of Color Harmony</h2><p>This is an essential basic book on color, written by the best-known colorist of our time for beginners seeking a thorough grounding in the comprehension and solution of color problems, and for mature artists and teachers interested in keeping abreast of recent findings and conclusions.</p><p>Faber Birren was born and educated in Chicago.

Once quiet agricultural land, Eastern Long Island first became popular among artists, architects, writers, and society patrons in the 1920s, when it served as a breeding ground for modernism. From the avant-garde influence of luminaries like Jackson Pollock, Robert Motherwell, and Willem de Kooning, to the high modernism of Le Corbusier, Philip Johnson, and Richard Meier, new ideas about art, architecture, and modern living transformed the Hamptons and ultimately made it the destination of choice for those seeking respite from the battles of Wall Street and Madison Avenue. In Weekend Utopia Alastair Gordon traces this fascinating and complicated trajectory, both in architectural terms-looking at modest beach houses and modern mansions alike-and in the life stories of the world-famous artists and designers, whose influence is felt on &#34;The Island&#34; even today. Over 175 photographs and illustrations detail the architecture, interiors, and nuances of these beautiful weekend homes, and provide an intimate portrait of the people who inhabit them. This engrossing book combines architectural history with a broad social perspective and paints a comprehensive picture of an area that in many ways shaped modern American culture.</p><p>The beach house was "the sonnet form of American architecture," writes Alastair Gordon. "This was where the revolution began." In his gracefully written, stunningly illustrated book, he shows how the evolution of summer housing on the once-rural eastern end of Long Island, New York, heralded key developments in architecture.<p> By the late 1920s, the sprawling Southampton mansions of Stanford White and others were pass�. The new style was a modernist box, raised up on supporting columns for protection and a better view, with a sun deck and floor-to-ceiling windows. (See <i>Palm Springs Weekend: The Architecture and Design of a Midcentury Oasis</i> or <i>Palm Springs Modern: Houses in the California Desert</i> for a West Coast version of modernist vacation home design.)</p><p> After World War II, the Hamptons became a favorite destination of New York artists, architects, and writers, who ushered in a period of fanciful experimentation. Then came the deluge. Gordon's own family, who bought their prefab beach home in the '50s, was part of a trend celebrated by <i>Life</i> magazine in 1959, the year Nixon and Khrushchev held their Kitchen Debate at a Leisurama house.</p><p> Gordon vividly describes the innovations of the '50s and '60s, from the stunningly pure Blake House (two square, ground-hugging sections with a central breezeway framing the ocean view) to the proud verticals of the Gwathmey House, clad in vertical cedar siding approximating the look of carved concrete. In the '70s, as ocean-view lots became scarce, some architects ignored the natural setting, creating imposing sculptural statements craning to isolate an elusive view. Others, including Robert Venturi and Jack Lenore Larsen, gave vernacular styles a postmodern twist.</p><p> Rightly decrying the neotraditional behemoths built in the '80s to satisfy the insecurities of the megarich, Gordon takes the long view. Each wave of newcomers remade this flat land in their own image, yet "something about it resists change." <i>--Cathy Curtis</i></p>For a good beach read (or a distraction from traffic on the Long Island Expressway) the coffee table-sized Weekend Utopia: Modern Living in the Hamptons chronicles successive waves of refuge seekers and the architectural innovations they spurred on, culminating in New York's beachfront babylon. After a decade as an East Hampton Star columnist and with his current gig as a House &amp; Garden contributing editor, Alistair Gordon has an insider's knowledge of the area, which he supplements with 75 color and 100 b&amp;w illustrations and photos. From the late-19th-century "Tile Club" to Pollock, De Kooning &amp; Co. to today's moguls, Gordon's eye for the convergence of arts, architecture and commerce is unerring. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Illustrated London News, 1917-1919 (Collected Works of GK Chesterton) (v.

Ms. Thomas lives in Oceanside, California.</p>THE BARD&#x2019;S MAP<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The night was cold and the wind whispered softly, rustling leaves and occasionally rattling the shutters of our small cottage. But the sky was so clear I could see every star, even the tiny ones. Despite the chill, I spent a lot of time outside looking at the sky. It was better than being inside our cottage, which held nothing but memories of happier times, and looking at my mother, sick with the wasting. Once she had been pretty, and even as she faced death, her eyes still held a twinkle.<br>&#x201c;&#x2019;Twas what your father first noticed about me: my eyes,&#x201d; she had told me many times. &#x201c;Lovely Mairi-Blue-Eyes, he called me.&#x201d; Large they were, like sapphires, except that I had never seen a real sapphire, so I had to take her word.<br>I felt a hand on my shoulder. It was Thomas, the Pig Boy. &#x201c;Old Mrs. Pinkett says to come in. She says...&#x201d;<br>He did not finish the sentence.<br>Somehow, we both knew this night would be my mother&#x2019;s last. There was so little left of her. Thomas squeezed my shoulder as I rose to go inside. I entered as quietly as I could, though the door creaked as a light wind rushed in beside me. Old Mrs. Pinkett nodded over at the bed where my mother lay. Her once soft arms now felt of brittle bone. But her eyes were more alive than ever.<br>&#x201c;Sing for me, Trinket,&#x201d; she whispered. So I sang for her the songs that we had made up in the years since my father left. They were not as beautiful as his, but we tried our best. For my mother always said that a house without music would be a lonely house indeed. When I finished, she raised a frail hand to my cheek.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve much to tell you, Trinket, and so little time,&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;First, tell me, once more, tell me the beginning,&#x201d; I said.<br>She drew a breath and began. &#x201c;Once, a handsome storyteller whisked a fair maiden off her feet with his silvery words and amazing tales. He promised her a story each night and during the whole of their time together, he was true to his word. He carried her off with his words to places far away. And when she finally agreed to marry him, he took her to a little cottage by the sea where they were most joyfully happy.<br>&#x201c;Their happiness was complete upon the birth of their babe. <i>Our precious child</i>, they called her, <i>our delightful trinket</i>, and that became her name. <i>Your</i> name: Trinket. The bard&#x2019;s daughter.&#x201d;<br>I smiled when she said my name.<br>Then she coughed. I turned to pour her some water, but there was Thomas, cup already in hand. I wanted to thank him but he disappeared as quickly as he&#x2019;d come. My mother coughed again, this time even more harshly. I gave her water, but she had trouble swallowing. She tried to speak, but her voice rasped, sounding small and choked.<br>I took over the telling, willing my own voice to be strong.<br>&#x201c;The traveling bard left one day when the girl was six, off on one of his storytelling, story-collecting adventures, for that was the life of a bard. He traveled from castles to villages, from coasts to mountains to valleys, telling the stories that were his own.<br>&#x201c;He kissed the top of the child&#x2019;s downy head,&#x201d; I went on. My mother smiled, for I had added the <i>downy</i> part since the last time. &#x201c;And called from the top of the hill, <i>I shall see you with the season&#x2019;s change</i>.&#x201d;<br>I hesitated, then continued.<br>&#x201c;But he never came back.&#x201d;<br>In a whisper, my mother took over the tale, adding the parts where perhaps he was kidnapped by pirates and forced to stay aboard a ship until he&#x2019;d told ten thousand tales, or perhaps he had defeated a fierce dragon by putting it to sleep with a bedtime tale and had to tame all the dragons in the land with his stories.<br><i>Yes,</i> she had told me time after time, <i>that is why he could never come back</i>.<br>My mother waited for his return. It took a long time for her heart to break completely. And when the illness came last winter, she had no fight left in her. A mended heart could have stood strong against the rampage of the fever and the wasting that followed. But a heart in little pieces had no chance.<br>She coughed and pulled me closer. &#x201c;Trinket, my sweet girl. You have choices to make, you know.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d;<br>I could live with Old Mrs. Pinkett and learn the healing arts, but as much as I liked her, I did not feel the call in my bones to heal others. That is what Mrs. Pinkett said I should feel if I were to learn from her. My bones felt only empty.<br>I could live with Thomas the Pig Boy and his mother and learn the care and keeping of pigs and the occasional sheep, but the smell was too much. And though Thomas and I had spent most of our lives together, playing and getting into trouble, I&#x2019;d no wish to be daughter to his mother. She was a rough woman with a sharp tongue that hurt far worse than getting a smack. How Thomas put up with it, I did not know.<br>My mother would want to know the direction I would take, Old Mrs. Pinkett had told me. It would help to ease her passing if she knew what my future might hold. But I was not so ready for my mother to leave. Not ready at all.<br>She looked at me, seeing more than I wished for her to. Her sapphire blue eyes squinted slightly. &#x201c;I know what you are thinking.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I am not even thinking in this moment. You must be mistaken.&#x201d; My lie sounded false, even to my own ears. The wind whispered and hissed through the cracks in the shutters as if doubting my words as well.<br>&#x201c;You are thinking of him.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Him who?&#x201d; Though we both knew exactly who <i>him</i> was.<br>My father.<br>&#x201c;You want to go and find him.&#x201d;<br><i>Did I?</i> I had never spoken these words, but in her last moments, my mother knew the questions I had been too afraid to ever ask.<br>&#x201c;There is a map, Trinket. A map in the old chest...&#x201d; She coughed again and this one rattled throughout the room. A gust blew open one of the shutters and it creaked back and forth whilst the wind whistled around us, secretive and chilling.<br>There was no time to dally, so I asked, &#x201c;What <i>really</i> happened to him, do you think?&#x201d;<br>She was quiet and her breath did not come for a moment, causing me to think that perhaps she was gone, but then she sighed and closed her eyes. The flurry in the room calmed to a gentle breeze.<br>&#x201c;I wish I knew.&#x201d;<br>Those were her last words.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>I cried for a whole week after she passed. I cried until the tears would come no more and my soul was empty.<br>&#x201c;&#x2019;Tis the way of things, lass,&#x201d; said Old Mrs. Pinkett. &#x201c;Death is but the other side of life.&#x201d;<br>Thomas cried, too, after I assured him it was not unseemly for a boy to do so. He&#x2019;d spent most of his life, when not with his pigs, skulking around our cottage. Eventually, we&#x2019;d set a place for him at our table each night. I think my mother thought of him as a son. A messy, wild son.<br>She was buried in a dress of blue cloth that she herself had woven two winters ago, for her hand at weaving was among the finest in the land. &#x2019;Twas a glorious shade, like the sky at dawn. With her hair brushed smooth, she looked almost as I wanted to remember her. Mrs. Pinkett, Thomas, and even Thomas&#x2019;s mother said words for her. But I said nothing. I could not say what was in my heart. I could not ask her if she was at last joining my father, or if he had abandoned her even in death.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Thomas was the one who found the map. He helped me go through my parents&#x2019; things. There was not much in the chest. Mostly tools and odd bits of cloth my mother had woven. There was a lovely mirror, small and silver, that we found by the back door of our cottage one winter&#x2019;s night. And my mother had saved the small velvet bags filled with coins that showed up mysteriously on the porch from time to time. I&#x2019;d keep the mirror, for my mother had loved it well. Perhaps it was a gift from an admirer. I had wanted to believe it was from my father, but my mother was certain it was not. <i>Why would he leave a gift and disappear? Nay, he&#x2019;s probably still composing lullabies for dragons,</i> she&#x2019;d say. Regardless, I would keep it. The velvet bags, though now empty, were of good quality and could be traded possibly. And there, underneath a fine cloak my mother had woven for special occasions, rolled up in a cracked leather canister, was the map.<br>&#x201c;Trinket, mayhap the map shows where your father traveled about,&#x201d; Thomas said.<br>&#x201c;Then why did he not take it with him the last time he went?&#x201d; I asked, although I knew the map had been my father&#x2019;s. But it helped me to argue with Thomas. I could only know what I was truly thinking when I had to defend one thought against another.<br>The map was soft and faded, drawn by my father&#x2019;s own hand in the black ink he always kept a small jar of on the shelf. But the ink in the jar had long since dried up, and the lines on the map had paled to a dirty brown. I traced an imaginary path from our town, through trees, to a far-off castle. Then I drew another, this time down the coast and to the villages by the sea.<br>&#x201c;What are you going to do with it?&#x201d; Thomas asked.<br>&#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d; My fingers trailed yet another direction, over the mountains to the forest.<br>He looked at me with eyes that widened as he understood my purpose.<br>&#x201c;You are not going to follow it!&#x201d; He spit when he yelled, which made it a good thing that Thomas the Pig Boy yelled very little.<br>&#x201c;I am.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You are only eleven.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Almost twelve. A year older than you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What will you do out there?&#x201d; Thomas asked, flicking the map with his hand.<br>&#x201c;Why, find my father, of course.&#x201d;<br><i>And I will leave this place, and all the pain, behind.</i><br>But I did not say this aloud.<br>Th...</p><h2>Unicorn Variations</h2><p>This collection of stories culled from every major science fiction magazine and anthology provides a retrospective of Zelazny&#39;s best stories and includes two Hugo award-winners, Unicorn Variation and Home is the Hangman</p><p></p><h2>God&#x2019;s Super-Apostles: Encountering the Worldwide Prophets and Apostles Movement</h2><p>God&#x2019;s Super-Apostles provides a concise entry-level overview of the key teachings and practices of the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) movement.

She currently operates a popular blog that critiques the New Apostolic Reformation, called <i>Spirit of Error</i> (www.spiritoferror.org).</p>In the first century, a Jewish synagogue in the Macedonian city of Berea received a special visitor who brought new teaching. This visitor was the apostle Paul. His teaching was that Jesus&#x2014;recently crucified and risen from the dead&#x2014;was the Jews&#x2019; long-awaited Messiah.<br> The people listened to Paul&#x2019;s new teaching with eagerness. They didn&#x2019;t chase him out of town and label him a false teacher for challenging their way of thinking. Rather, they showed a sincere open-mindedness about what he had to say. But they also wanted to be sure his teaching was true. These Bereans spent days searching their Scriptures to see if they supported the new teaching. After determining that they did, many became followers of Jesus.<br> What does this story from so long ago&#x2014;found in Acts 17:10-12&#x2014;have to do with the book before you? Quite a lot.<br> In the twenty-first century, churches in small towns and large cities throughout the world encounter teachers who, like Paul, are bringing new teaching. These teachers&#x2014;part of the &#x201c;New Apostolic Reformation,&#x201d; NAR&#x2014;also call themselves &#x201c;apostles&#x201d; and &#x201c;prophets.&#x201d; Their teaching is that churches must submit to their leadership so they can advance God&#x2019;s kingdom and prepare the earth for Christ&#x2019;s return.<br> Like the teaching Paul brought to Berea, the teaching of today&#x2019;s apostles and prophets is not unimportant. It has major effects on churches and the everyday lives of individual Christians.<br> So, how should Christians respond to the new NAR teaching? <br> The same way the Bereans did. We should hear it out with true sincerity and an open mind. We should not be quick to dismiss this teaching or to label it false&#x2014;just because it&#x2019;s new to us. We should give it a fair hearing to see if it presents important truth that we have missed.<br> We should also be sure the teaching is true. That means we should patiently search the Scriptures to see how this teaching matches up. If it does, then we should believe it&#x2014;even if it goes against our own conservative traditions and limited experiences, and even if it makes us uncomfortable. But if it doesn&#x2019;t line up with Scripture, then we must cast it aside.<br> It&#x2019;s with this spirit&#x2014;of open-mindedness, fairness, and thoughtfulness&#x2014;that we&#x2019;ve endeavored to write this book. <br> This is more than an academic exercise. I&#x2019;ve have wrestled passionately with specific passages of Scripture and asked God to guide me to correct understanding. In addition to studying their literature I&#x2019;ve attended NAR churches and conferences to observe NAR leaders deliver their teachings. And I&#x2019;ve spent countless hours talking with people who have been part of this movement&#x2014;seeking to understand it from their point of view. As a result, I sometimes found that my long-standing assumptions about certain issues were mistaken. Perhaps you will, too.<br> Some readers may suspect we&#x2019;re &#x201c;anti-charismatic.&#x201d; They may expect us to argue that the &#x201c;miraculous gifts&#x201d; described in 1 Corinthians 12&#x2014;including the gifts of prophesying, healing, and speaking in tongues&#x2014;are no longer active in the church today. This is not our objective. Many Christians around the world&#x2014;including charismatics and classical Pentecostals&#x2014;believe that the miraculous gifts are still active, and we do not dispute their belief. We&#x2019;ve tried to show that NAR teachings do not represent the views of most charismatics or classical Pentecostals&#x2014;but are entirely different.<br> We emphasize that not all people who are affiliated with NAR hold to all the same beliefs. As with any other large, multi-faceted movement, participants in NAR hold to a spectrum of beliefs, accepting some NAR teachings and being unaware of or rejecting others. Furthermore, not all NAR leaders work together or agree on everything. When we critique a particular teaching in this book, we don&#x2019;t mean to imply that all NAR leaders we address in this book hold to that same teaching. And when we use the descriptive term &#x201c;NAR&#x201d; to refer to specific leaders, books, organizations or the like, we do not mean to imply that these leaders, books, organizations, or other entities share all the same views.<br> We don&#x2019;t address the most recent &#x201c;manifestations&#x201d; of the Holy Spirit that are occurring in NAR churches or the latest teachings or prophetic words. The phenomena observed in some of these churches&#x2014;such as the making of &#x201c;animal noises,&#x201d; &#x201c;Holy Laughter,&#x201d; and appearances of &#x201c;angel feathers&#x201d;&#x2014;come and go quickly and new phenomena take their place. Even the &#x201c;Glory Cloud&#x201d; that was reportedly making appearances at Bethel Church in Redding, California, a couple years ago has almost been forgotten. There&#x2019;s a good reason these phenomena come and go. People in NAR believe that God is always doing a &#x201c;new thing&#x201d;&#x2014;and they hope not to miss out on the &#x201c;current move of the Holy Spirit&#x201d; by focusing on a &#x201c;past move.&#x201d;<br> Rather than addressing each passing manifestation or latest prophetic word, we believe it will be more helpful to provide an enduring framework for understanding and evaluating NAR teachings as a whole. With this big-picture framework you&#x2019;ll have a better understanding of NAR than many participants in the movement have. They may hold to a particular teaching here and another one there, but not understand how the teachings fit together into a larger theological framework that is the basis of NAR.<br> If you have a loved one who has been drawn into this movement and you want a brief and accurate introduction to it, or if you are simply curious and want a basic introduction, this book is for you. After reading this book, if you want to know more, we encourage you to read our other book about this movement, A New Apostolic Reformation? A Biblical Response to a Worldwide Movement. There we go into much greater depth evaluating NAR teachings and describing the global influence of the movement.<br></p><h2>Engagement Is Not Enough: You Need Passionate Employees to Achieve Your Dream</h2><p>Lack of employee engagement is like a cancer, eating away at your organization&#39;s vital organs. It saps your organization&#39;s strength, directly affecting your organization&#39;s ability to achieve the levels of customer satisfaction, productivity and profitability you know you could achieve. Keith Ayers presents a compelling argument that the focus on engagement has failed because leaders think engagement can be bought through bonuses, benefits, and share options. That is like trying to cure cancer with an aspirin or band-aid. The cure for the cancer of disengagement is for leaders to look in the mirror at the leadership they provide. In this in-depth exploration of the leadership skills needed to get every employee to want to perform at their best, Ayers challenges leaders to stop focusing on engagement, and set their sights on igniting the fire of passion in their employees.</p><p></p><h2>Fairy Magic Pop-up (Flower Fairies)</h2><p>Colorful, pop-up, three-dimensional illustrations bring to life the Flower Fairies, and clever rhymes give basic information about each plant.</p><p></p><h2>American Classics for Children Little Women Pollyanna Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (American Classics For Children, II)</h2><p>Beautifully designed book with great illustrations on the cover of all three of these famous fictional girls who have become a part of American folklore.

Its champions have been portrayed in the first century, in the Arthurian period and in the Middle Ages. In essence, the Grail is timeless. Following the success of the international bestseller Bloodline of the Holy Grail, this illustrated account illuminates the Grail legacy with lavish images from the Pharaohs of Egypt, to Jesus and his Apostles, to Medieval Grail maidens. Genealogist and historical lecturer Laurence Gardner offers real proof of a family line descending from Jesus Christ, documenting the royal heritage of the Messiah and a systematic suppression of records, while tracing the sacred lineage through the centuries. He also exposes a multitude of errors deliberately written into historical reference books, beginning with the Gospels themselves.</p><p></p><h2>Gurdjieff: A Biography : The Anatomy of a Myth</h2><p>In this first major biography of George Ivanovitch Gurdjieff, James Moore offers an entertaining and reliable introduction to one of the Western world&#39;s most remarkable and little-understood revolutionary thinkers.

Gurdjieff&#39;s work is perhaps more relevant today than ever before and this masterly tribute has a vital role to play in ensuring that his ideas reach new generations of readers in search of authentic spiritual teachings.</p><p>James Moore has been active in Gurdjieffian circles since 1956, and is the author of &#39;Gurdjieff and Mansfield&#39;. He enjoys a worldwide correspondence with people interested in Gurdjieff and his teaching.He felt an &#39;irrepressible striving&#39; to understand clearly the precise significance, in general, of the life process on earth of all the outward forms of breathing creatures and, in particular, of the aim of human life in the light of this interpretation. But why this deep speculation upon life? Gurdjieff after all was a grazier&#39;s son, and had learnt to shoot a wolf or squash a louse without the least philosophizing. Perhaps in one special sense, the stars in their courses had drawn him to his transcendent question.</p><h2>Enchanted Tiki Room (Enchanted Tiki Room: Disney Kingdoms)</h2><p>Welcome to the Enchanted Tiki Room, a place of legend...of fantasy...and mystery.

He has worked as a pharmacist, software engineer and freelance journalist, but now writes full time.In his first novel, British author Stross, one of the hottest short-story writers in the field, serves up an energetic and sometimes satiric mix of cutting-edge nanotechnology, old-fashioned space opera and leftist political commentary reminiscent of Ken MacLeod. Spaceship engineer Martin Springfield and U.N. diplomat Rachel Mansour hail from an Earth that has gone through the Singularity, an accelerated technological and social evolution far beyond anything we can imagine. The Singularity was triggered by the Eschaton, a super-powerful being descended from humanity that can travel in time and that essentially rules the universe. Springfield and Mansour meet on the home world of the New Republic, a repressive, backwater society that has outlawed virtually all advanced technology other than that necessary for interstellar warfare. When one of the New Republic's colonial worlds is besieged by the Festival, an enigmatic alien intelligence, the Republic counterattacks, using time travel in an attempt to put its warships in position to catch the Festival by surprise. Springfield and Mansour, working for different masters, have both been assigned the task of either diffusing the crisis or sabotaging the New Republic's warfleet, no matter what the cost. As a newcomer to long fiction, Stross has some problems with pacing, but the book still generates plenty of excitement.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Deadly Business: Sam Cummings, Interarms, and the Arms Trade</h2><p>Describes Sam Cummings&#39; founding and development of the munitions company, Interarms, and examines its position in the international arms trade</p><p></p><h2>The Living Fire: New and Selected Poems</h2><p>A rich and significant collection of more than one hundred poems, drawn from a lifetime of &#x201c;wild gratitude&#x201d; in poetry.<br><br>In poems chronicling insomnia (&#x201c;the blue-rimmed edge / of outer dark, those crossroads / where we meet the dead&#x201d;), art and culture (poems on Edward Hopper and Paul Celan, love poems in the voices of Baudelaire and Gertrude Stein, a meditation on two suitcases of children&#x2019;s drawings that came out of the Terezin concentration camp), and his own experience, including the powerful, frank self-examinations in his more recent work, Edward Hirsch displays stunning range and quality.

What he ended up with instead was <em>The Ocean at the of the Lane</em>--his first adult novel since <em>Anansi Boys</em> came out in 2005, and a narrative so thoughtful and thrilling that it's as difficult to stop reading as it was for Gaiman to stop writing. Forty years ago, our narrator, who was then a seven-year-old boy, unwittingly discovered a neighboring family&#x2019;s supernatural secret. What happens next is an imaginative romp through otherwordly adventure that could only come from Gaiman's magical mind.

Back then, most experts believed that differences in how girls and boys behave are mainly due to differences in how they were treated by their parents, teachers, and friends. <br> <br>It's hard to cling to that belief today. An avalanche of research over the past twenty years has shown that sex differences are more significant and profound than anybody guessed. Sex differences are real, biologically programmed, and important to how children are raised, disciplined, and educated. <br><br>In <i>Why Gender Matters</i>, psychologist and family physician Dr. Leonard Sax leads parents through the mystifying world of gender differences by explaining the biologically different ways in which children think, feel, and act. He addresses a host of issues, including discipline, learning, risk taking, aggression, sex, and drugs, and shows how boys and girls react in predictable ways to different situations. <br><br>For example, girls are born with more sensitive hearing than boys, and those differences increase as kids grow up. So when a grown man speaks to a girl in what he thinks is a normal voice, she may hear it as yelling. Conversely, boys who appear to be inattentive in class may just be sitting too far away to hear the teacher&#x2014;especially if the teacher is female. <br><br>Likewise, negative emotions are seated in an ancient structure of the brain called the amygdala. Girls develop an early connection between this area and the cerebral cortex, enabling them to talk about their feelings. In boys these links develop later. So if you ask a troubled adolescent boy to tell you what his feelings are, he often literally cannot say.<br><br>Dr. Sax offers fresh approaches to disciplining children, as well as gender-specific ways to help girls and boys avoid drugs and early sexual activity. He wants parents to understand and work with hardwired differences in children, but he also encourages them to push beyond gender-based stereotypes. <br><br>A leading proponent of single-sex education, Dr. Sax points out specific instances where keeping boys and girls separate in the classroom has yielded striking educational, social, and interpersonal benefits. Despite the view of many educators and experts on child-rearing that sex differences should be ignored or overcome, parents and teachers would do better to recognize, understand, and make use of the biological differences that make a girl a girl, and a boy a boy.</p><p><p>It has long been assumed that the difference between the behavior and attitudes of boys and girls can be traced to the way they are treated by parents, teachers, and friends. But an avalanche of recent research has made it clear that gender differences are a biological reality and that they play a significant role in the development of personality traits and intellectual and social skills. <br><br>In WHY GENDER MATTERS, Dr. Leonard Sax explains in clear, accessible language how the brains of boys and girls differ and shows parents why recognizing these differences is an important step in raising happier, healthier children. Addressing a wide range of issues, including discipline, learning, risk-taking, aggression, sex, and drugs, Sax discusses the impact of hardwired biological factors on kids' reactions to parental questions, opinions, and advice. Parents of preteens and teenagers will appreciate his straightforward guidelines for using a gender-appropriate approach in counseling children about such highly charged matters as drug use and sexual activity. His argument in favor of single-sex education, based on studies showing that creating separate classrooms for boys and girls yields enormous educational, social, and interpersonal benefits, is bound to provoke lively debate about one of the most controversial issues in education today. <br><br>WHY GENDER MATTERS encourages parents to take advantage of the latest information about gender differences without embracing old-fashioned, limiting stereotypes. Integrating theory and solid how-to advice, it is vital reading for all parents, regardless of their child's age or gender.</p><p><b>LEONARD SAX, M.D., Ph.D.</b>, is a physician and a psychologist and the founder of the National Association for Single-Sex Public Education.&nbsp;His scholarly work has been published in a wide variety of prestigious journals including <i>American Psychologist</i>,<i> Behavioral Neuroscience</i>,<i> Journal of the American Medical Association</i>,<i> Journal of the American College of Nutrition</i>,<i> Journal of Family Practice</i>,<i> Annals of Family Medicine</i>,<i> Journal of Sex Research</i>,<i> </i>and others.&nbsp;He has been a featured guest on CNN, PBS, Fox News, Voice of America, NPR&#x2019;s <i>Talk of the Nation</i>,<i> </i>and many other news programs, discussing the importance of sex differences in how children learn.</p></p><h2>You Wouldn&#39;t Want to Be a Greek Athlete: Races You&#39;d Rather Not Run</h2><p>A light-hearted look at what life would be like as a Greek athlete.</p><p></p><h2>BORNE PB</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p><p><strong>&nbsp;&#x201c;Am I a person or a weapon?&#x201d; Borne asks Rachel, in extremis. &#x201c;You are a person,&#x201d; Rachel tells him.</strong></p><p><strong>&#x201c;But like a person,</strong><strong> you can be a weapon, too.&#x201d;</strong></p><p>In <em>Borne</em>, the epic new novel from Jeff VanderMeer, author of the acclaimed bestselling Southern Reach trilogy, a young woman named Rachel survives as a scavenger in a ruined, dangerous city of the near future.

Sachs offers a practical strategy to move America, seemingly more divided than ever, toward a new consensus: sustainable development. Sustainable development is a holistic approach that emphasizes economic, social, and environmental objectives in shaping policy. In focusing too much on economic growth, the United States has neglected rising economic inequality and dire environmental threats. Now, even growth is imperiled.<br><br>Sachs explores issues that have captivated the nation and political debate, including infrastructure, trade deals, energy policy, the proper size and role of government, the national debt, and income inequality. Not only does he provide illuminating and accessible explanations of the forces at work in each case, but he also presents specific policy solutions. His argument rises above the pessimism born of political paralysis, economic stagnation, and partisanship to devise a brighter way forward, achievable both individually and collectively. In <i>Building the New American Economy</i>, Sachs shows how the United States can find a path to renewed economic progress that is fair and environmentally sustainable.</p><p>A powerful set of solutions to champion for those worried about the future of the United States.Jeffrey D.

He discovered for himself just how great that price can be when, while writing his second novel, he spiraled into a profound depression that threatened his life.</p><p>This crisis provoked him to search for the source of his malaise. Did it begin with him, or did it begin before, possibly even long before, with previous generations whose genes he bore? If so, how had the "family illness," as he came to think of it, shaped their lives, and come to define his? To find the answers, he launched into a full-scale investigation of his family's history&#x2014;one of the oldest, and fully documented in America. It was, at once, a very personal journey of self-discovery, and a broader retracing of his family's evolution, as he pored over the many extraordinary Sedgwicks who had gone before&#x2014;from the protean early Speaker of the House Theodore Sedgwick through to Edie Sedgwick, Andy Warhol's muse and the 1960s "It Girl." Both a brimming family saga and a courageous narrative, the book paints a startlingly candid portrait of a man and an eminent American family.</p></p><p><p>John Sedgwick is the author of the novels <em>The Dark House</em> and <em>The Education of Mrs. Bemis</em>, and contributes regularly to <em>Newsweek</em>, <em>GQ</em>, and <em>The Atlantic</em>, among other publications. He lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p>In this overwritten family biography&#x2013;cum&#x2013;memoir, novelist Sedgwick (<i>The Education of Mrs. Bemis</i>) traces in great detail multiples generations of his wealthy yet ill-starred family. Beginning with his own near suicide, Sedgwick takes the unrelenting trials and tribulations of his family and tries to tie them to some parallel history of the U.S. It doesn't work. Reaching back to the late 18th century, the family Sedgwick was in the upper tier of New England society. In Sedgwick's telling, Theodore Sedgwick, a prosperous attorney, set the family off to its posh but difficult history by swindling an old Native American woman out of her property in western Massachusetts. Building a grand country home&#x2014;a home that would become both family redoubt and scene of some intergenerational depravities&#x2014;Theodore suffered from what would now be diagnosed as depression. In fact, depression and madness dog the coming generations most famously in the incarnation of Edie Sedgwick, Warhol superstar, world-class drug addict and celebrity suicide. This memoir is not without its pleasures. Sedgwick has a keen eye for detail and a voracious appetite for family lore and history (Catherine Maria Sedgwick was a popular mid-18th-century author; Kyra Sedgwick is an actress). The finely honed prose glides along effortlessly; it just doesn't add up to much. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He never wanted to be a big brother. And he certainly didn&#x2019;t want Jin Woo, the little baby from Korea, to join the family. Now Jin Woo is getting all the attention, and David feels as if no one cares about him anymore. But then a surprising letter helps him to understand that being a brother can mean being surrounded with more love than ever.<br>Eve Bunting and Chris Soentpiet bring the same deep emotion that distinguished their previous collaboration, So Far from the Sea, to this moving story of an adoptive family that has love to spare.</p><p><p>Eve Bunting has written&nbsp;over two hundred&nbsp;books for children, including the Caldecott Medal-winning <i>Smoky Night,</i> illustrated by David Diaz, <i>The Wall</i>,<i> Fly Away Home</i>, and <i>Train to Somewhere</i>. She lives in Southern California.</p>"Bunting's sensitive writing tells of Jin Woo's arrival from David's point of view, infusing the story with childlike sensibility and humor. . . .Soenpiet's watercolors are suffused with light and perfectly capture the characters' expressions" School Library Journal<br><br>Among the prolific Bunting's many talents is a propensity for distilling complex social issues into accesible picture books that begin to make subjects such as the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, adult illiteracy, and homelessness more understandable to younger children. This picture-book exploration of the arrival of an adopted Korean baby named Jin Woo is the second collaboration by Bunting and Soentpiet (So Far From the Sea, 1998) and as a Korean adoptee himself, the talented Soentpiet is particularly well-qualified to illustrate this one. Jin Woo's story is told in the present tense from the viewpoint of the baby's older brother, a six- or -seven-year-old named David, who is also adopted. He is alternately sad, hopeful, unbelieving, and excited at this change in his life, which is an accurate portrayal of the whirlwind of feelings that surround any new big brother. David's parents are understandably thrilled with their joyous emotions captured in both Bunting's text and in Soentpiet's detailed, realistic paintings. His large-format illustrations are the book's main strength, surpassing Bunting's serviceable story, which is not as compelling as some of her other picture book texts. There are some wonderful recent books on inter-country adoption (notably Rose A. Lewis's I Love You Like Crazy Cakes, 2000), but very few that focus on the mixed feelings of older siblings. This will find a ready audience with many adoptive families, especially those preparing to adopt Asian babies.<br>Kirkus Reviews<br><br>Jin Woo is the baby that's coming from Korea to be adopted by David's family, but David's not sure how he feels about having a little brother. The night before Jin Woo's arrival, the family goes to a Korean restaurant. The next day, they pick up the baby at the airport, where David gets to hold the chubby, happy child. When his mother reads him a comforting letter "written" by Jin Woo, David feels things will work out after all. The story's climax comes when David decides to give his brother the duck mobile that spins over his bed. However, the pictures make David look at least seven; a mobile at that age seems a bit bizarre. Otherwise, the art is the high point of this solid piece of bibliotherapy. It has a photographic clarity that makes these characters real enough to touch, and adorable Jin Woo looks eminently huggable. A solid choice for adoption shelves, especially for those looking for material on international adoption.<br>Booklist, ALA</p><h2>Growth and Decline of the Cuban Republic</h2><p>Growth And Decline Of The Cuban Republic, The by Batista, Fulgencio</p><p></p><h2>The Macrolichens of New England (Memoirs of The New York Botanical Garden, Volume 96)</h2><p>The Macrolichens of New England is the most comprehensive work of its kind.

She calls herself Julie, says she&#x2019;s from California, and slips back to a rented room at night. In truth, home is Garland, Tennessee, where two young men have just been paroled. Both were jailed for a crime that Grace planned.&nbsp;The heist went bad&#x2014;but not before she was on a plane to Prague, contraband in her bag.&nbsp;As Grace&#x2019;s web of deception unravels, she begins a cat-and-mouse game that echoes the best of Alfred Hitchcock and Patricia Highsmith and is sure to appeal to fans of <i>The Girl on the Train.</i></p><p><b>Rebecca Scherm</b>&nbsp;is the critically acclaimed author of the novel <i>Unbecoming. </i>A graduate of New York University and the Helen Zell Writers' Program at the University of Michigan, Scherm has written for&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i>,&nbsp;<i>Jezebel</i>,&nbsp;and <i>The Toast</i>. She lives in Ann Arbor, Michigan.<p></p><p>I</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Paris</p><p></p><p></p><p>1</p><p>The first lie Grace had told Hanna was her name. &#x201c;Bonjour, je m&#x2019;appelle Julie,&#x201d; Grace had said. She&#x2019;d been in Paris for only a month, and her French was still new and stiff. She&#x2019;d chosen the name Julie because it was sweet and easy on the French tongue&#x2014;much more so than Grace was. The best lies were the simplest and made the most sense, in the mind and in the mouth. These lies were the easiest to swallow.</p><p>Jacqueline, the boss, had shown Grace to her worktable, abutting Hanna&#x2019;s, and where to store her tools in the jars along the center crack, what she could borrow and what she would need to procure herself. Hanna had reached out to cover a jar of picks and pliers. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t share these,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said with a taut smile, like someone forced to apologize.</p><p>When Grace sat down on her spinning stool a few minutes later, Hanna asked where she was from. Grace was so obviously American.</p><p>&#x201c;California,&#x201d; Grace said, because most people already had ideas about California. They didn&#x2019;t ask you to explain it to them. Grace hated lying, got no joy from it, and this was how she knew she wasn&#x2019;t pathological. But California satisfied people so easily, even in Paris. Garland, Tennessee, where Grace was really from, was a confusing answer that only led to more questions. &#x201c;Tennessee?&#x201d; Hanna might have started. &#x201c;Elvis?<i> P�quenauds</i>?&#x201d; Hillbillies? When Grace had lived in New York, everyone who asked her where she was from followed her answer with the same question: &#x201c;What&#x2019;s <i>that </i>like?&#x201d;</p><p>As if her journey from somewhere as tiny and undistinguished as Garland had required a laborious transformation. As if getting from Garland to New York City had been some kind of pilgrimage to the first world.</p><p>Grace had been in Paris for two years now, and she had been Julie from California since her arrival. Her life was conducted entirely in French, another kind of disguise. She and Hanna seldom discussed anything deep in the past, and when the conversation took an unwelcome turn, they quickly righted themselves. Facing each other across their tables, they hunched over their antiques and talked of busted hinges and gouged veneer, not sorrow or worry, not home.</p><p>The boys would be paroled tomorrow, released from Lacombe and sent home to Garland with their families. It was three o&#x2019;clock in Paris now, morning in Tennessee. Riley and Alls would be eating their last breakfast of powdered eggs and sausage patties, doughy-faced guards planted behind them. Grace had always imagined them together, but she&#x2019;d begun to imagine their lives without her so long ago that she often forgot how little she really knew. She didn&#x2019;t know a thing about their lives anymore. She hadn&#x2019;t spoken to them in more than three years, since before they were arrested for robbing the Wynne House: three years of imagined sausage breakfasts.</p><p>He wouldn&#x2019;t come for her, she told herself. It had been too long.</p><p>Grace had often felt like two people, always at odds, but when the boys had gone to prison, one Grace had stopped her life&#x2019;s clock. Now it had begun to tick again. She had no control of Riley now, what he would do and where he would go, and these unknowns bred in her a private, shapeless dread. She&#x2019;d left lies unleashed in Garland and now she couldn&#x2019;t mind them.</p><p>Riley and Alls were twenty years old when they were sentenced to eight years each in Lacombe. This was the minimum: it was their first offense, they were unarmed, and, more important to Judge Meyer, they were &#x201c;not your typical criminals,&#x201d; and Riley&#x2019;s family was a <i>nice</i> family. The Grahams had lived in Garland for seven generations, and Alls benefitted from the association&#x2014;as had Grace, when she&#x2019;d been associated. Grace often thought that if Alls alone had been charged with the crime, he would not have gotten off as easy, and that if only Riley had been charged, he probably would have gotten off altogether. Greg had pled guilty too, but his parents had won him a plea bargain for turning in his friends. He was released in a year.</p><p>Grace had robbed the Wynne House too, and she could not go home again.</p><p>She remembered the moment&#x2014;maybe it had lasted minutes or maybe days; she didn&#x2019;t remember&#x2014;after the judge had handed down the eight-year sentence, but before she&#x2019;d learned that they could be paroled in only three. Eight years had seemed an incredible length of time. Eight years was longer than she had known Riley. Eight years seemed long enough for everyone to forget.</p><p>She gave the birdcage&#x2019;s latch a final swipe with the chamois and called for Jacqueline. The filigree onion dome alone had taken her nine days to clean. The wire metalwork was so fine that from a distance, it might have been human hair. On the first day, she&#x2019;d held the vacuum hose in her left hand and the hair dryer in her right, blowing off dust and sucking it up before it could land again. Then she&#x2019;d spent more than a week swabbing the curlicues with dental tools wrapped in cotton and paintbrushes dipped in mineral spirits. This morning she&#x2019;d finished scraping off centuries of songbird guano from the cage&#x2019;s floor. It wasn&#x2019;t a birdcage anymore, but a gilded aviary, <i>orientaliste</i>, late nineteenth century, nearly as tall as Grace was. Jacqueline would return it to the dealer who had purchased it from the flea market, and he would sell it for at least five thousand, maybe much more. Perhaps it would be wired for electricity and made into a chandelier. Maybe an orchid collector would use it to shield his best specimens from human hovering.</p><p>When Jacqueline emerged from her skinny office beneath the stairs, Grace stood apart from her work. She waited as her boss pulled a pair of white cotton gloves from the bin next to the tables. Jacqueline ran her gloved index finger lightly along the wires. She gently turned the latch on the door and bent close to listen to its movement. She craned to see the underside of the onion dome.</p><p>&#x201c;�a suffit,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>That was as approving as Jacqueline got. She did little restoration herself, only the most basic things&#x2014;regluing a horn handle to a letter opener, or cleaning larger metalwork&#x2014;and only what she could do while on the phone. Now she clacked over to Amaury&#x2019;s dark alcove, where he was slumped over an open watch. After decades in exactly that position, his shoulders had slid into his belly. Jacqueline reached for the watch, but Amaury grunted and swatted her hand away. He&#x2019;d been at Zanuso et Filles the longest. He&#x2019;d even worked for the original Zanuso, back when Jacqueline and her sister were the <i>filles</i>. Jacqueline had neither the head nor the hands for antiques restoration, but she was the senior Zanuso now. Grace supposed that made her and Hanna the <i>filles</i>.</p><p>Hanna cleared her throat, eager for their boss&#x2019;s attention. Last week she&#x2019;d begun a new project, and now she wanted to show off her progress.</p><p>&#x201c;C&#x2019;est parti,&#x201d; Jacqueline said, squeezing the bridge of her nose. &#x201c;Yes, Hanna?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My beaded centerpiece is Czech, 1750 to 1770,&#x201d; Hanna said, though they all knew by now. &#x201c;I will have it to the decade by the end of the week.&#x201d;</p><p>Hanna was sitting in front of the shared computer, clicking through the hundreds of photographs she&#x2019;d taken of her project. The centerpiece was the size of a card table and divided into four quadrants, each containing beaded miniatures of flora and fauna: spring blossoms, a summer peach orchard, an autumn crop harvest, and a snowy thicket with white wool sheep and shepherdesses. The centerpiece had clearly once been exquisite, if silly. Grace imagined it as a diorama that some young countess had hired palace artists to build for her. The trees, their leaves made of cut silk, were as detailed as real bonsai.</p><p>&#x201c;The materials,&#x201d; Hanna continued, &#x201c;are linen and pinewood, glass, mica, copper, brass, steel, lead, tin, aluminum, beeswax, shellac, white lead, paper, and plaster of Paris.

It&#x2019;s a very big job.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want any help.&#x201d;</p><p>Jacqueline put her finger to her lips. &#x201c;Until something else comes in for her to do, she will assist you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to measure all the old wires,&#x201d; Hanna said to Grace. &#x201c;The new ones will be steel, which won&#x2019;t be historically correct, of course, but my primary objective is to preserve the integrity of the object&#x2019;s intention.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Which is to be a centerpiece,&#x201d; Grace said.</p><p>&#x201c;Precisely.&#x201d;</p><p>Hanna was Polish, thirty-four, twelve years older than Grace, whom she treated like an unexpected and unwanted little sister. Hanna was small and as thin as a young boy, with closely cropped blond hair and blond skin and pale gray eyes. Her crisp androgyny was so thorough that it sometimes distracted older Parisians, who wanted to peg her as one sex or the other before selling her a sandwich. &#x201c;Sans fromage,&#x201d; Hanna would say. &#x201c;Pardon?&#x201d; they would respond, still looking for clues. &#x201c;Sans fromage, pas de fromage,&#x201d; she would repeat, blinking, her frame as straight and pert as a parking meter. She wore silver-rimmed glasses and clothes only in shades of beige.</p><p>When Grace had started at Zanuso, she&#x2019;d hoped that her humble beginnings would appeal to Hanna&#x2019;s arrogance, which had been obvious from the start. She&#x2019;d thought maybe Hanna would help her, out of either pity or some sense of big-sister altruism. But Hanna had no such inclinations. She was one of six daughters of a rural Polish grocer and she hadn&#x2019;t seen her family in more than a decade. No one, Grace gathered, had ever helped Hanna do a goddamn thing. Grace and Hanna&#x2019;s friendship was an often crabby by-product of professional respect: Grace had done well at Zanuso without asking for help, and <i>that</i> Hanna noticed. Grace envied Hanna&#x2019;s unfiltered confidence, her clipped and precise judgments. Grace struggled to calculate the probable reactions to nearly everything she said before she said it, looking for risk and reward and hidden pits she might trip in. She&#x2019;d never met a woman who cared so little about causing offense.</p><p>Now Grace pulled her stool around to Hanna&#x2019;s table, where a long row of wires was arranged by size. She pulled a ruler from Hanna&#x2019;s cup and saw Hanna flinch a little. She would have preferred that Grace use her own tools. Grace took the first of the hundred wires, set it against the ruler, and recorded the measurement on the list Hanna had laid out on a sheet of graph paper. Nineteen centimeters. She placed the wire back in the row, just to the left so she wouldn&#x2019;t accidentally measure it again, and picked up another. Eighteen and three-quarters centimeters.</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>Grace had met Riley when she was in sixth grade, just turned twelve. He was a year older. At her first middle school dance, he had plucked her from a gaggle of girls she wanted badly to impress, and she and Riley had swayed, arm&#x2019;s length apart, to the ballad over the loudspeaker. He&#x2019;d invited her to his house for dinner, where Mrs. Graham gently chatted to Grace about school while her husband and four sons stripped three roast chickens in ten minutes. Riley, the youngest, was the worst, lunging for the last of the potatoes while Grace was still figuring out how to cut her chicken breast with her fork and not make so much noise against the plate. Mrs. Graham reached to still Riley&#x2019;s hand and suggested he save seconds for his friend before he helped himself to thirds. &#x201c;Some chivalry, please,&#x201d; she had said. Grace had read the word in books, but she&#x2019;d never heard anyone say it out loud.</p><p>Grace tried not to stare at her, but Mrs. Graham pulled at her attention whenever Grace looked away. Mrs. Graham was thin and tan and freckled, with sleepy green eyes that turned down slightly at the outside. She had a slow blink; Grace thought she could feel it herself, as though a light had briefly dimmed. Her cool, feathery brown hair curled under where it hit her collar. Grace admired the light shimmer on her high cheekbones, her sea-glass earrings, her low and tender voice. Her fingers were long and delicate, nails polished with a milky, translucent pink, knuckles unfairly swollen from arthritis. That Grace&#x2019;s own nails were bitten to the quick had never bothered her before.</p><p>At the end of the week, Riley had kissed her in the school hallway between bells, so quickly that she wondered later if she had imagined it. Within a month he had bought her a necklace, a gold dolphin on a thin chain, and pledged his love. She felt as if she were in the movies.</p><p>What she wouldn&#x2019;t give to see herself and Riley like that, from above&#x2014;to watch a flickering reel of Riley, his hair still victory red (it hadn&#x2019;t yet begun to fade), pulling her toward him on the sweaty, squeaking floor of the gym. Had she been scared, excited, smug? She&#x2019;d been just a child, and then she had entered a <i>we.</i> An <i>us-</i>ness. She and Riley had seemed cute to his parents and their teachers, something from <i>Our Gang</i>, but Riley had three older brothers and the precocity that came with them, and Grace had no one else.</p><p>Tomorrow, Riley and Alls would be released.</p><p>She felt as if she had been standing in a road at night, watching a car&#x2019;s distant headlights approaching so slowly that she had forever to step out of the way. Now the car was upon her, and still she had not moved. She imagined what tomorrow would look like: Riley&#x2019;s parents, or maybe just his father, going to pick him up at the prison. Dr. Graham would bring him a change of clothes. Riley had worn a thirty-two-thirty-two. Did he still? He would look different. He would be paler, less freckled, from lack of sun. And he would be older, of course. Twenty-three. She kept thinking of them as boys, but they weren&#x2019;t boys anymore.</p><p>Dr. Graham would bring Riley&#x2019;s old clothes, a pair of worn khakis and one of his paint-stained button-downs with holes in the elbows. <i>Here</i>, the bundle of clothes would say, <i>this is who you were and will be again</i>. Grace imagined Riley riding home in the passenger seat of the Grahams&#x2019; ancient blue Mercedes wagon, the diesel loud enough to bring the neighbors to the windows. Everyone would know today was the day. Mrs. Graham would have made barbecue, probably pork shoulder. And Riley&#x2019;s brothers would be there. Grace didn&#x2019;t know if all three still lived in Garland, but they probably did. The Grahams belonged to Garland as much as Garland belonged to them. She imagined Riley excusing himself from the cookout and going inside to sit on his bed in his old bedroom, which would be his room again, at least for a while. She wondered if he would go upstairs, to the attic bedroom Mrs. Graham had made up for when Grace stayed over.</p><p>Where would Alls go tomorrow? Did his father still live in Garland? He would have no welcome-home party. She imagined Alls and his dad driving through Burger King on the way home, unless he went home with Riley. He would have, before, but that meant nothing. The line between before and after couldn&#x2019;t be sharper.</p><p>When people had read about the Wynne robbery as a footnote in a national newspaper, small-town folly picked up on the wire, t...</p></p><h2>Making Sense of Christian Art and Architecture /anglais</h2><p>Making Sense of Christian Art &amp; Architecture is designed to equip the cultural tourist and art student with the means to interpret each painting, building, or artifact in terms of the iconography and symbolism of Christianity.

She is unsurpassed at shaping both the odd and the everyday into genuinely surprising photographs that subtly yet powerfully challenge our preconceptions or intensify our convictions. Mary Ellen Mark's poetic and at times disquieting photographs form a fascinating portrait of a complex, amusing, and occasionally unsettling country and its people.</p><p><b>Mary Ellen Mark </b>is one of the most important photographers of this century. She lives in New York City.<br>With a candid intimacy uniquely her own, acclaimed photographer Mark partners with her subjects to make compassionate and complex portraits. By photographing her subjects in their environments, she creates powerful contextual images that make larger comments on the state of affairs in U.S. society. The images span the United States, ranging from Aryan Nations members in Idaho to rodeo workers in Texas, ballroom dancers in Florida, and shelter residents in New York. Also notable are the serial portraits done over years, as with those of Tiny from Seattle (1983-99) and the Damm family (1987-94). This quality collection is an exciting confirmation of Mark's contribution to contemporary photography and will serve both those familiar with her work, as well as newcomers. Mark's 12th book, this first broad survey of her American photographs from the beginnings of her career in 1963 to the present accompanies a major traveling retrospective organized by Aperture opening next month at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Highly recommended for large public and academic libraries, this is also an affordable overview of her work for small public libraries.<br><i>-Debora Miller, Minneapolis </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Eldest</h2><p>Darkness falls...Despair abounds...Evil reigns...Eragon and his dragon, Saphira, have just saved the rebel state from destruction by the mighty forces of King Galbatorix, cruel ruler of the Empire Now Eragon must travel to Ellesmera, land of the elves, for further training in magic and swordsmanship, the vital skills of the Dragon Rider.

The story is solidly in the tradition (some might say derivative) of the classic heroic quest fantasy, with the predictable cast of dwarves, elves, and dragons--but also including some imaginatively creepy creatures of evil.<p> The land of Alagaesia is suffering under the Empire of the wicked Galbatorix, and Eragon and his dragon Saphira, last of the Riders, are the only hope. But Eragon is young and has much to learn, and so he is sent off to the elven forest city of Ellesmera, where he and Saphira are tutored in magic, battle skills, and the ancient language by the wise former Rider Oromis and his elderly dragon Glaedr. Meanwhile, back at Carvahall, Eragon's home, his cousin Roran is the target of a siege by the hideous Ra'zac, and he must lead the villagers on a desperate escape over the mountains. The two narratives move toward a massive battle with the forces of Galbatorix, where Eragon learns a shocking secret about his parentage and commits himself to saving his people.</p><p> The sheer size of the novel, as well as its many characters, places with difficult names, and its use of imaginary languages make this a challenging read, even for experienced fantasy readers. It is essential to have the plot threads of the first volume well in mind before beginning--the publisher has provided not only a map, but a helpful synopsis of the first book and a much-needed Language Guide. But no obstacles will deter the many fans of Eragon from diving headfirst into this highly-awaited fantasy.

Internationally recognized as the voice of reason and compassion, Dr. Elkind showed that in blurring the boundaries of what is age appropriate, by expecting-or imposing-too much too soon, we force our kids to grow up far too fast.In the two decades since this groundbreaking book first appeared, we have compounded the problem, inadvertently stepping up the assault on childhood in the media, in schools, and at home. Taking a detailed, up-to-the-minute look at the world of today&#39;s children and teens in terms of the Internet, classroom culture, school violence, movies, television, and a growing societal incivility, Dr. Elkind shows a whole new generation of parents where hurrying occurs and why and what we can do about it.</p><p><b>David Elkind</b>, Ph.D., is Professor Emeritus at Tufts University and the author of a dozen books, including <i>The Hurried Child</i> and <i>All Grown Up and No Place to Go</i> . He lives outside of Boston and on Cape Cod.These two books offer excellent perspectives on children, parents, and culture. Psychologist Apter (The Confident Child) argues that we've been hanging on to an idea that's all wrong that when children finish high school or college and land a job, they instantly become autonomous, responsible adults. This "myth of maturity," insists Apter, is harming our kids. These "thresholders" (ages 18-24) appear to function as adults (whether in a job or in school), but in reality they are often in turmoil, depressed, and overwhelmed by life. Apter claims that though parents have been taught that they should end support (emotional, financial, and practical) so that their children can be independent and self-reliant, this is the wrong approach. Each chapter addresses a theme (job stress, finances, college, emotions) with stories of thresholders Apter has interviewed followed by her advice to both parents and thresholders on how to deal with the situation. Myth shatters many common notions we've held for several decades, e.g., it links eating disorders to separation anxiety and lays to rest the idea that the l8-24s are confident, happy, and sexually active beings. Like Elkind, Apter knows that kids grow up fast (that is, they leave childhood) but that they aren't "grown up" at all. Elkind's classic The Hurried Child dates from 1981 and was revised in 1988; now it appears in a third edition. The basic premise remains the same: parents have pushed their children emotionally and intellectually too far, too fast. Today's parents think of their kids as Superkids, so competent and so mature that they need adults very little. Why? Because parents, who are building careers, blending families, or struggling as single parents, have no time for child rearing. Having a competent Superkid relieves these parents of guilt, but it places too much stress on the children themselves. This new edition is fully revised, with new sections on peer-group parent pressure, i.e., the pressure parents feel to go along with the Superkid image out of fear that their own children will lag behind, and on organized sports, the Internet, and software for infants. Like Apter's title, this powerful book is essential reading.

Millions have relished the story of the bookish and big-hearted Episcopal priest and the fullness of his seemingly ordinary life. Now, in the first novels of a new series, Jan Karon enchants us with the story of the newly retired priest&#x2019;s spur-of-the-moment adventure. For the first time in decades, Father Tim returns to his birthplace, Holly Springs, Mississippi, in response to a mysterious, unsigned note saying simply: &#x201c;<i>Come home</i>.&#x201d; A story of long-buried secrets, forgiveness, and the wonder of discovering new people, places, and depth of feeling, <i>Home to Holly Springs</i> will enthrall new readers and longtime fans alike.</p><p><b>Jan Karon</b>, born Janice Meredith Wilson in the foothills of North Carolina, was named after the title of a popular novel, Janice Meredith.<p>Jan wrote her first novel at the age of ten. "The manuscript was written on Blue Horse notebook paper, and was, for good reason, kept hidden from my sister. When she found it, she discovered the one curse word I had, with pounding heart, included in someone's speech. For Pete's sake, hadn't Rhett Butler used that very same word and gotten away with it? After my grandmother's exceedingly focused reproof, I've written books without cussin' ever since."</p><p>Several years ago, Karon left a successful career in advertising to move to the mountain village of Blowing Rock, North Carolina, and write books. "I stepped out on faith to follow my lifelong dream of being an author," she says. "I made real sacrifices and took big risks. But living, it seems to me, is largely about risk."</p><p>Enthusiastic booksellers across the country have introduced readers of all ages to Karon's heartwarming books. <i>At Home in Mitford</i>, Karon's first book in the Mitford series, was nominated for an ABBY by the American Booksellers Association in 1996 and again in 1997. Bookstore owner, Shirley Sprinkle, says, "The Mitford Books have been our all-time fiction bestsellers since we went in business twenty-five years ago. We've sold 10,000 of Jan's books and don't see any end to the Mitford phenomenon."</p>Even listeners unfamiliar with Karon&#39;s Mitford series will enjoy this story of Father Tim Kavanaugh&#39;s visit to his hometown of Holly Springs. Here he hopes to reconcile himself with the memories of his past. Scott Sowers&#39;s gentle performance of Father Tim portrays him as a humble man of good humor. The story&#39;s transitions from the present to childhood memories are done with ease as Sowers voices the youthful Kavanaugh. As Father Tim searches for people from his past, he makes several new friends, and Sowers renders them all with enthusiasm. Sowers delivers just the right amount of tension as Father Tim&#39;s search leads him to confront a painful truth that will have a major impact on his future.

Girzone</b> retired from the active priesthood for health reasons and took up his lifelong dream of writing. He is the author of <i>Joshua; Joshua and the Children; Joshua and the City; Who Will Teach Me; Gloria: A Diary;</i> and <i>Kara, the Lonely Falcon.</i> He lives in Altamont, New York.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br>The record-breaking winter had frozen everyone's spirits. A happy event was needed to melt the gloom and free everyone from the depression that hung over the community. The consecration as bishop of a priest who was loved by almost everyone was that event. The previous weeks, and months, had been cold and dismal, but this day seemed to make up for it all. The weather was perfect. The sun bright and warm, the crisp air fresh from the morning dew, the cool, blue sky with hardly a cloud, all hinted of an early summer. Happy voices filled the air. The sidewalks surrounding the massive Gothic cathedral were teeming with people of every race and religion. An unusual number of Jews, some with beards and long black coats, mingled with their friends; at a distance from them in another section of the crowd was a small group of Muslims, a handful wearing fezzes. There was a sprinkling of Oriental people, too. It was hard to imagine all of these people fitting into the building even as vast as it was, but its huge, bronze-framed doorways swallowed them all as they poured through.<br><br>Tommy Burns was a squat, thickly built Irishman. He and his wife, Emily, were walking toward the cathedral next to a rabbi. Tommy was curious as to why a rabbi, especially the old-fashioned kind, was going to a Catholic bishop's consecration. Never reserved, Tommy asked him.<br><br>"Rabbi, if I am not being ignorant or too forward, why would a man like yourself be coming to a bishop's consecration?" Tommy asked bluntly.<br><br>The rabbi, taken aback, answered simply, "Because he is much more than a bishop to me. Our congregation will always be indebted to David Campbell. When the state was going to take away our synagogue to build a highway, David used his influence with the governor's office to have the course of the highway moved. He is like one of our family. He visits and prays with us on many Friday nights. It is as if one of our own was being made bishop. Perhaps you could tell me why you have come to his consecration."<br><br>Tommy grinned. "About six months ago I lost my job and couldn't keep up the mortgage payments on my house. The bank was starting foreclosure proceedings. My wife and I were beside ourselves. If we couldn't afford the mortgage we wouldn't be able to afford rent either. We had nightmares about being thrown out in the streets with our five kids. Mysteriously the money appeared, enough to pay the mortgage until I was able to find a job. It was only later we found out that it was Father Campbell who had sent the money through one of my cousins whom he knows, and that he had sold his own car to raise the money. I'll never be able to pay him back, but I was told he didn't want it back. You don't come across people like that very often. Some people say he's tough when it comes to Church matters, but I can't imagine it."<br><br>By that time the two were approaching the entrance to the church. The street was still crowded. Uniformed policemen had difficulty keeping clear the walkway from the rectory so the procession could advance in orderly fashion. As the bells tolled in powerful bursts of joyful exuberance, the procession emerged from the rectory. First came the deacon bearing the Book of the Gospels, its gold and jeweled cover glistening in the sun. He was followed by altar boys and girls, then the part of the choir that was not already in the church, and ranks of clergy of various denominations, including Orthodox bishops in their unusual trappings. Then emerged the consecrating bishops and Archbishop O'Connell from the neighboring archdiocese. Last was the bishop-elect, David Campbell, with his two assisting priests.<br><br>Father Campbell was impressive in his priestly robes. He was tall and not powerfully built, but scholarly-looking. His walnut-colored hair was slightly wavy, and his metal-rimmed glasses accented his intellectual appearance.<br><br>His long, tapering fingers moved gracefully as he waved to people lining the procession route, a shy smile etching his finely chiseled features. His thin face showed the strain he had been under since his call to the bishopric. A long, thin nose of precise proportion was set between warm, penetrating brown eyes that smiled easily, betraying a kind peacefulness beneath the surface. His look seemed to linger rather than move rapidly, hinting at a thoughtfulness that absorbed everything, weighing carefully, never forgetting. David was not a simple man. What appeared on the surface of his life gave no indication of the wholly different world that existed beneath, into which he would not allow even his most intimate friends to penetrate.<br><br>As the procession moved into the church, working its way up the aisle, the organ music stopped and the choir intoned the processional, magnified by the almost two thousand happy voices that filled the vast, vaulting sanctuary. Many of the bishops were smiling to people they recognized as they walked up the aisle. The bishop-elect, his hands folded with palms pressed together, seemed unaware of anything around him. His eyes looked straight ahead but not seeing, as if he were absorbed in thoughts of things far away, or deep within.<br><br>As the procession approached the sanctuary, only the officiating bishops and their assistants entered, together with the bishop-elect and his two assisting priests. He was seated before the altar facing the congregation.<br><br>"In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit," the archbishop intoned. The congregation roared its "Amen." "My brothers and sisters," he continued, "we have come here today from many places and many backgrounds, but all as God's children. He is very much present here with us as we prepare for the consecration of our friend David as bishop. As we call upon our Father to witness and consecrate what we do, we humbly acknowledge our own sins and failings, and beg for His forgiveness. Lord, have mercy. Christ, have mercy. Lord, have mercy."<br><br>The Liturgy of the Word continued, and after the Gospel, the ordination of the bishop-elect took place. The choir sang <i>"Veni, Creator Spiritus":</i> "Come, Creator Spirit, touch the minds of these your children, fill with your heavenly grace these hearts you have created."<br><br>During the singing of the hymn, David was led by his assistants to the place of consecration.<br><br>"Most Reverend Father," one of the priests addressed the archbishop, "the Church of this diocese asks you to ordain this priest, David, for service as bishop."<br><br>"Have you the mandate from the Holy See?" the archbishop asked.<br><br>"We have."<br><br>After the letter was read, the archbishop addressed the whole assembly. "Consider carefully the position in the Church to which our brother is about to be raised. Our Lord Jesus Christ, who was sent by the Father to redeem the human race, in turn sent twelve apostles into the world. These men were filled with the power of the Holy Spirit to preach the Gospel to every race and people into a single flock to be guided in the way of holiness. Because this service was to be until the end of time, the apostles selected others to help them. By the laying on of hands which confers the sacrament in its fullness, the apostles passed on the gift of the Holy Spirit, which they themselves had received from Christ. In that way, by a succession of bishops unbroken from one generation to the next, the powers conferred in the beginning were handed down, and the work of the Savior lives and grows in our time." Then, looking at David, he continued, "You, dear brother, have been chosen by the Lord to guide His people. You have been chosen to serve rather than to rule, and to proclaim the good news of Jesus endlessly. You are called to be a good shepherd in imitation of the Master. Love all those entrusted to you' the poor, the sick, the weak, strangers, and the homeless, as well as those who are rich in the things of this world. May your own life be blameless and a shining reflection of the goodness of Jesus Himself. And may God have mercy on your soul, as you accept this awesome responsibility."<br><br>The liturgy, stripped of all the medieval pageantry that had once characterized these ceremonies, was still impressive. The rich traditions of the Church, the unbroken line of priestly power and authority that Jesus had given to His apostles and which He had intended should be passed on forever, were reflected in every facet of the beautiful and timeless rite. David could trace his own spiritual lineage to one of the apostles through the unbroken line of succession. It was a graphic expression of the organic bond between the Church of every age with the living Christ who walked the roads of Palestine.<br><br>After all the preliminary interrogations and prayers, the bishops laid their hands on David as he knelt before them. With the Book of the Gospels held above his head, the archbishop recited the prayer of consecration over him: "...Father, pour out Your Spirit upon Your chosen, that he may be a shepherd of Your holy flock and a high priest blameless in Your sight. Grant him every power You bestowed upon the apostles themselves, so he may carry on their work in our time. May he be pleasing to You by his gentleness and purity of heart, presenting a fragrant offering to You, through Jesus Your Son."<br><br>After the consecration, the symbols of office were presented: the Book of the Gospels, the ring, the miter, and the shepherd's staff. The Mass continued as usual, but when the ceremony ended, thunderous applause spontaneously erupted, attesting to the extraordinary popularity of this quiet and unassuming cleric.<br><br>It was difficult for many of David's colleagues to understand the reason for his popularity, since his recent assignments were not high profile situations in which he could cultivate a following. He worked part-time at the chancery, where he had a reputation for exact observance of Church law. When people called for help with difficult predicaments, he would always listen, but if help demanded bending any of the rules or countermanding canon law, he could be uncompromising. Many people left hurt and more alienated from the Church than before they came to see him. He could be cold and detached when applying the law. The book was everything. That was most probably the reason he was selected to be bishop. He was predictable and dedicated to what was expected of a loyal Church official.<br><br>Two women on the chancery staff summed it up as they gossiped while exiting the church. "How do you explain why there are so many unusual people here today?" Joan Carey asked the chancery receptionist, Marilyn Cotugno. Joan was not one of David's most avid fans. "I'll never get over the way he handled my sister's case when she came to him for advice. I thought that of all the priests at the chancery he would be the one most likely to understand her problem. She came home that night crying, vowing she'd never go to church again. I certainly can't see why people think he's so great. Charlie Mayberry was really upset when David's appointment was announced."<br><br>"Don't you think that was because he was jealous? Charlie would have loved to have been made bishop," Marilyn interjected.<br><br>"That's possible, but Charlie still doesn't think much of David. He's forever criticizing the way he does things and tried to get him appointed pastor just to get him out of the chancery."<br><br>Marilyn liked David and wasn't about to let him be hacked at like this even by her friend. "Well, how do you explain the unusual demonstration of affection today?"<br><br>"It's beyond me," Joan answered with a look of bewilderment.<br><br>"Perhaps it's from people he works with in his free time," Marilyn put in by way of David's defense. "He does have a reputation for quietly working with all kinds of people, non-Catholics included, and for helping people in trouble. I'll never forget the time he took a part-time job on the docks to earn money to buy food for poor families whose income was so little they could hardly survive. My Jewish friends tell me he goes to their synagogue on Friday nights and says his prayers in Hebrew. Even Muslims like him because he fights with immigration on behalf of family members who had been refused entrance into the country on technicalities. You have to admit he's shrewd the way he uses his contacts. I think that's the real David. What we see in the chancery is the company man who always goes by the book, but that's what's expected of him. I'm sure that's the reason he was made bishop, because he was such a good company man. I think we are really going to get a surprise once he gets a chance to be himself."<br><br>Marilyn wasn't far from wrong. It was for the thorough and faithful performance of his official responsibilities that David was now being rewarded by the Church.<br><br>The ceremony over, the clergy met at the cathedral rectory briefly, then departed for the civic center for the lavish dinner and gala festivities. The governor was there, along with other state officials and dignitaries from faraway places. People obviously thought much of and expected much from this new celebrity; they felt honored to have been invited to his ordination.<br><br>David was unusually quiet at the dinner, although he talked warmly and politely to everyone, graciously expressing his gratitude to each for attending and for the good wishes. As the day wore on one could see the strain in his face and sense his need to be away from the crowd, alone.<br><br>That is just what he did when it all ended. A man other than David might have preferred further celebration and camaraderie; but after thanking the archbishop and all the other bishops, he left for his home to spend the night alone.<br><br>After falling into a deep sleep on the couch for a few hours, he woke up and had a drink. Then he went to his room and knelt at his prie-dieu, which faced a stark reproduction of the Crucifixion by El Greco. As he knelt, his face resting in his hands, he became absorbed in his thoughts.<br><br>"O, my God, what have I done? What have I taken upon myself? For years I sensed this day would come, and as it approached I became more and more fearful. If only they had known the visions, the thoughts, the conflicts that haunted me, they would never have done this. Now I am here and there is no turning back. For the rest of my life I must live this calling, not as others see it, but as I, under the light of Your grace, understand it. Help me, God, I am frightened. Jesus, Good Shepherd, teach me. I will follow You faithfully wherever You may lead. Only guide me, I am afraid."<br><br>David prayed intermittently. At intervals his mind wandered. He did not know whether he had fallen off to sleep and had dreamed dreams, or whether in his openness to God, God was speaking to him.<br><br>One dream -- or revelation or vision -- was particularly disturbing. A woman, troubled and crying, a look of haunting anguish on her face, was pointing at David. "You have done this to me. You have done this to me. I trusted you as I trusted God and you turned me away. Now see my children. Look at them, see what has happened to them, and all because of you." Two children appeared in the dream, boys in their late teens, angry children, throwing stones at a church and turning to David with the accusation, "Righteous priest, god without a heart. If that's what he's like, you keep him. We'll have none of him."<br><br>David recognized the woman and the boys. She had come to him years ago with a problem. Her husband had left her and abandoned the children. In her loneliness, she had found a man who cared for her and was devoted to the children. They in turn loved him as a father. The woman had been raised in a rigidly traditional family and was troubled over the affair. She decided to tell David the whole story.

Through the wavery antique panes in the elderly wooden windows, the full moon seemed to wobble liquidly.<br><br>Or maybe that was because he was seeing it through tears. Angrily he swiped them away, then closed his hand reflexively on the rabbit&#x2019;s foot hanging from a thin chain on his belt loop.<br><br>Not, he realized miserably, that the talisman he&#x2019;d carried around for years was going to give him any good luck tonight. How could it? After all, it wasn&#x2019;t as if he hadn&#x2019;t known what he was getting into, becoming involved with Carolyn.<br><br>In the blue-white moonlight downhill beyond the houses of town, Passamaquoddy Bay was a pewter-colored disk. Above, a plane&#x2019;s contrail streaked thinly northeast through the indigo night, the aircraft itself already racing out over the Atlantic.<br><br>&#x201c;Carolyn?&#x201d; Two miles distant across the bay on the Canadian island of Campobello, a car&#x2019;s headlights appeared, then vanished.<br><br>&#x201c;Carolyn, are you still there?&#x201d;<br><br>She said something in reply, but he couldn&#x2019;t make out what. He&#x2019;d forgotten how poorly his cell phone worked here in remote downeast Maine; his city phone plan was wrong for the area. But he hadn&#x2019;t wanted to use the landline. Someone in the house might pick up an extension and overhear this conversation.<br><br>Its tone, especially: the ragged pain in his own voice, which he tried to hide, and the carelessness in hers, which she didn&#x2019;t. The CD player on his laptop played the Roche sisters&#x2019; first album, nearly as old as he was but in its wry lyrics and harmonies the perfect background music for him now.<br><br>&#x201c;I had dinner and then a few drinks with Siobhan,&#x201d; Carolyn went on unconvincingly. &#x201c;It got late, she let me sleep on her couch. End of story, okay?&#x201d;<br><br>Through the window, he watched clouds begin streaming in gauzy tatters over the moon. Something ugly was coming, according to the weather forecast he&#x2019;d heard earlier. Something . . .<br><br>&#x201c;Chip?&#x201d; The leafless branches of the ancient maples lining Key Street were elongated fingers, reaching out for something they could never have. Like me, he thought miserably, still clutching the rabbit&#x2019;s foot.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;End of story.&#x201d; But of course it wasn&#x2019;t.<br><br>Silence from Carolyn, who after two days of not answering her cell or responding to his messages had at last taken his call. Now he imagined her sitting cross-legged in the oversized leather easy chair he&#x2019;d bought for their apartment in Manhattan, a year ago when they&#x2019;d first moved in together.<br><br>Her slim frame clad in a black leotard and a smock dress--the purple corduroy one, maybe, now that it was November and getting chilly--and her glossy dark hair falling in waves over her shoulders, she would be tapping her long nails impatiently on the chair&#x2019;s soft leather arm. Her high-heeled boots would be on the thick Persian rug nearby, probably, flung where she&#x2019;d shed them.<br><br>&#x201c;Have you eaten lately? I mean today?&#x201d; he asked. She wasn&#x2019;t lazy, and she could be very well organized. But Carolyn had never learned to take care of herself.<br><br>She had him for that. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; she said guiltily. &#x201c;But I will. Chicken and corn, maybe. And a baked potato.&#x201d;<br><br>Yeah, right. The idea of her cooking a meal for herself in his absence, let alone a decent one, was beyond far-fetched. More likely she was subsisting on takeout until he got back.<br><br>If she was even eating that. But he didn&#x2019;t press it. &#x201c;Sounds good,&#x201d; he told her instead, not wanting to start a quarrel. &#x201c;Drink some fruit juice with it,&#x201d; he advised, knowing she wouldn&#x2019;t do that, either. In her simple obduracy Carolyn was like a stone, impenetrable unless you wanted to crush it, or break it.<br><br>And he&#x2019;d never wanted to. After nearly three years&#x2019; working together, he as the researcher and she the writer of a string of bestselling true-crime books, they&#x2019;d become a couple, and Chip had briefly thought his life was complete. Even before they began sharing the same address he&#x2019;d imagined them curled together in the leather chair, large enough to hold them both comfortably.<br><br>Just how comfortably, he had also pictured in considerable detail. But once it was delivered, Carolyn had claimed the chair as her own, her pointy knees and sharply jutting elbows fencing it off from him silently but definitively.<br><br>&#x201c;Chip? You believe me, right? About last night?&#x201d;<br><br>His hand felt cramped. Tucking the phone awkwardly in the crook of his neck, he heard the signature opening fanfare of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno coming on in the background at her end.<br><br>Good old Carolyn, the original multitasker. &#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; Chip said, absently worrying the cuticle on his right thumb. &#x201c;Like you said, you were at Siobhan&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br><br>This too was improbable, however. Siobhan was Carolyn&#x2019;s editor, and in that role had proven to be an honorable, reliable friend. But she was about as likely to have a writer sleeping on the sofa in her elegant apartment overlooking Gramercy Park as she was to have bedbugs infesting it.<br><br>&#x201c;I believe you,&#x201d; he said, since what good would it do to say otherwise? Carolyn was in Manhattan, over five hundred miles away, and he was here visiting his old friend Sam Tiptree in a place so different from the city, it felt like some other planet.<br><br>&#x201c;Good.&#x201d; He heard relief in Carolyn&#x2019;s voice. It was this faint whiff of her caring that he clung to, knowing she depended on him not to give up on her or forsake her. He&#x2019;d never done that either, even when he&#x2019;d known her only as his employer, the writer of crime literature.<br><br>Which it was: What she wrote was never just another hack job on yet another wife-murder, child disappearance, or greed-fueled parent-slaughter, turgid tomes mixing sex, cash, and subnormal IQs to predictably gory effect. Instead, word by word and sentence by carefully crafted sentence, she presented the human elements behind the headlines, delicately and in their subtlest colors.<br><br>It was what he&#x2019;d loved first about her, this freakish genius she had for communicating the emotions and motives of others while--the tragic irony of this did not escape him--possessing almost no insight into her own. But there was more.<br><br>Much more. Even now, if he&#x2019;d been there he&#x2019;d have gathered her in his arms, brushing aside the jutting knees and the sharp little elbows, and that would&#x2019;ve been the end of it. For a long time her mercurial side had seemed a small price to pay for the rest of it.<br><br>All the rest of it. &#x201c;You should get some sleep,&#x201d; he told her gently. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re okay? You&#x2019;re going to be able to?&#x201d;<br><br>Sleep, he meant. She wasn&#x2019;t any better at that than she was at eating, when he was away.<br><br>He heard her put her drink down on the low marble table that had been her only contribution to the room&#x2019;s decor, the little click of the glass striking stone. Even that had been grudging; if he&#x2019;d left it to her they&#x2019;d still be using stacked milk crates.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m okay.&#x201d; Then: &#x201c;Chip?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; he exhaled. All the rest of it . . . which he&#x2019;d adored, and still did. The trouble was, something was changing. And in the week since he&#x2019;d been away from her it had gotten worse, this feeling of not being able to bear the few things he didn&#x2019;t adore.<br><br>A lot worse. &#x201c;Chip, could you do me a favor? Call up Maury Cahill for me, ask if I could go in and see him for a minute?&#x201d;<br><br>Chip felt his mental eyebrows rising; Cahill was a criminal lawyer specializing in the kinds of scandalously illegal antics rich people&#x2019;s kids got up to, keeping them out of Rikers and off the front pages of newspapers.<br><br>Maury&#x2019;s son had been Chip&#x2019;s classmate at prep school; they still got together for a beer once in a while. But why might Carolyn need his old school pal&#x2019;s dad?<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s for a friend,&#x201d; she assured him hastily but unconvincingly. Still, if she or her &#x201c;friend&#x201d; needed a lawyer, she had picked a good one.<br><br>And a request from Chip would indeed produce the desired appointment. So he agreed to phone Maury Cahill in the morning, then made a mental note to check in with him again later in the day. The old attorney wouldn&#x2019;t violate any oaths, but if Carolyn was in real trouble he&#x2019;d probably give Chip a general heads-up.<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; said Carolyn. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry I didn&#x2019;t call you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right.&#x201d; He knew she was sorry. That wasn&#x2019;t the point. &#x201c;Get some rest. Just . . . go on to bed. You&#x2019;ll be all right tomorrow.&#x201d;<br><br>Would he be, though? The trouble was, he was beginning not to be sure how much longer he could take the situation before something bad happened. He drew his gaze from the moonlit rooftops, skeletal tree shapes, and the few warmly lit windows still visible in the village of Eastport at this late hour, and from the metallically gleaming bay. Here in this room the softly hissing radiator and the wallpaper&#x2019;s faded florals lent the sense that everything might still be fine, that he could get through this somehow.<br><br>His shirts and slacks hung on hangers in the tiny closet, but his socks and underwear were still in his suitcase, open on one of the plain pine twin beds. The room-size rug was a threadbare Persian long missing its fringes, indigo and red.<br><br>The bedspreads, white chenille, smelled of soap and bleach. &#x201c;Listen,&#x201d; he told Carolyn. &#x201c;Tomorrow you&#x2019;ll work, and you&#x2019;ll feel fine. And when I come home, we&#x2019;ll look at my new research together, all right?&#x201d;<br><br>Across the room on a round wooden table were heaped his open laptop, stacks of papers, and spiral notebooks, preliminary materials having to do with a series of killings in Milwaukee two years earlier. If all went well, the crimes were to be the subject of his and Carolyn&#x2019;s next book.<br><br>Atop the heap lay a photograph of a human torso, or what was left of it after someone got done with the acts he&#x2019;d committed upon it. All told--if indeed all had been told; the perpetrator had died in jail of a heart attack before he finished confessing--there were a dozen photos like this. All were taken by the killer while committing the crimes, about one per month during the time he had been active.<br><br>Which was another thing nobody was sure of: How long? And its corollary, How many? The accused man had said a year, but his methods were sophisticated. His staging of tableaux, especially, was what the FBI analyst out of Madison had termed &#x201c;fully developed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, Chip, I&#x2019;ll sleep,&#x201d; Carolyn agreed, sounding subdued. &#x201c;And work sounds good.&#x201d;<br><br>The victims in the dozen photographs had all been young women. These were the only known photographs in the series, but a new cache of them might yet turn up, Chip believed, because the police weren&#x2019;t the only ones who had seen the pictures. Long before his capture, the killer had also posted them on the Web, in private chat rooms Chip had found while following obscure links the way a hound sniffs scent.<br><br>He&#x2019;d phoned and emailed the Wisconsin authorities in case they didn&#x2019;t already know about the websites, but hadn&#x2019;t heard back yet. He&#x2019;d never have found the sites himself if his own research talents weren&#x2019;t as prodigious as Carolyn&#x2019;s writing chops.<br><br>But through long practice and stubborn persistence, Chip could click his way unerringly to a needle in an electronic haystack; thus he&#x2019;d discovered the forums where the gruesome pictures had resided, and since then memories of what else he&#x2019;d seen and read there clung dankly to the inside of his head. Chat rooms for killers, he thought, what a concept.<br><br>&#x201c;Good night, Chip,&#x201d; Carolyn said. &#x201c;I love you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I love you, too,&#x201d; he answered, because he did.<br><br>He truly did. &#x201c;Good night,&#x201d; he added, and hung up.<br><br>Only then did he realized that while he and Carolyn were talking, he&#x2019;d torn off the strip of cuticle he&#x2019;d been worrying without even feeling it, and now the rabbit&#x2019;s foot he always carried was smeared with his own bright red blood.<br>Just across the hall in his own room, Chip&#x2019;s old friend Sam Tiptree was also having problems with women.<br><br>Two women, to be precise.<br><br>WHERE R U? W8TNG W8TNG W8TNG<br><br>The first one, pretty and fun-loving Carol Stedman, had been texting him all evening. She wouldn&#x2019;t take no for an answer, which under other circumstances he tended to find attractive.<br><br>He supposed he should have known that she was going to be a difficult girlfriend; from the start, she had not by any means been a safe bet. He&#x2019;d met Carol while she and a guy she&#x2019;d been traveling with were wreaking small-town havoc--no violence, and the money and stolen car were recovered, but still--in Eastport, and this had been an omen of things to come, relationship-wise.<br><br>I HV SMTHNG 4 U . . .<br><br>I&#x2019;ll bet, Sam thought.

Her face is toffee-colored and round; her eyes, the eyes of a foreigner, slanted and brown. They are not my mother's eyes: irises of brilliant green, set obliquely in almond-shaped sockets above high cheekbones.<br><br>They said I looked exotic, she classic. Together-a bamboo-colored redhead carrying her olive-sinned, curly-haired toddler-together, we seemed alien. Skin fractured our kinship.<br><br>When I was young, riding in the supermarket cart's basket, strangers looked from me to her and back again.<br><br>"She's so cute! Is she yours?" they'd ask.<br><br>"Yes, she's mine," Mommie would answer before turning the basket in another direction. Looking behind her, sometimes I saw their faces turn sour. I learned to recognize the expression well before I knew what it meant.<br><br>At night, before she put me to bed, Mommie and I would find our likenesses. She would ask, 'Who's got a perfect little forehead?"<br><br>I'd point above my brows.<br><br>"You do!" She'd say with a nod. 'Who's got a perfect little nose?"<br><br>"I do!" I'd say, and she would agree again.<br><br>"Who's got perfect little hands?"<br><br>"We do!"<br><br>We laughed over this, our shared proportions: our hands shaped alike-the pinkie exactly half the length of the ring finger, the index and ring fingers each a half inch shorter than the second digit, our nails shaped the same. Even the arches of our feet arced in the same curve, and our toes, too, had a similar square outline.<br><br>My mother was an aspiring actress. We lived in the orbit of show business and its backstage shenanigans, where races mixed out of sight of the public. She had separated from my father, a well-known song-and-dance man, shortly after I was born, in January 1954, six months before the Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education decision desegregated the country's schools.<br><br>By the time I was three, Negroes in Montgomery, Alabama, had forced the city to integrate its city buses. In Manhattan the buses were already integrated, but an immutable social line nevertheless divided the races, even in the Upper West Side building where Mommie and I lived. African Americans worked there as elevator men but could not rent apartments. The civil-rights movement had not made a dent in our social sphere.<br><br>"She looks Chinese," acquaintances guessed, considering the fold of my eyes, the pale olive cast of my skin, my full lips. Oriental-looking, said the middle-aged woman who took care of me much of the time, whom I would come to call "Aunt Peggy."<br><br>Aunt Peggy was trying to soothe my feelings-"Oriental-looking Negro women were considered pretty back then-but I knew I wasn't Oriental. Wrapped in a bright yellow towel after my bath, I contemplated the women in the framed Gauguin prints on our walls: their seal-slick black manes, their knowing smiles. Even as a toddler, I somehow grasped that these women would not have considered me Oriental. My mother liked to call me "Tahitian June," but if I were really Tahitian, why wasn't my hair waist long like theirs?<br><br>My skin had not yet fully darkened, and my mother lived in fear that we would be found out.<br><br>'She'd pass if it weren't for her hair," I overheard Mommie say one day, and my heart collapsed. I didn't know what she meant by that word 'pass" but the tone in her voice sounded the way the faces of the people in the supermarket looked.<br><br>I went to the bathroom, climbed atop the toilet seat, and leaned over the sink to explore my short, soft, frizzy curls in the mirror.<br><br>My mother's hair fell over her eyes in a bouncy auburn flip that flirted with the world. My hair didn't flip. My curls, soft when they were less than an inch long, frizzed straight out if they grew longer. Mommie made sure they didn't get that long. Cute, Aunt Peggy called my boyish cut. Unusual for a girl, she'd say as she smoothed her own wavy black hair into a French twist. She looked at me in a half-cocked way that meant she didn't really think it was cute, but odd.<br><br>In front of the mirror, I tried to pull my hair back with my mother's tortoiseshell comb. The fragile teeth snapped, tangling like splintered tears in my curls.<br><br>As far back as I could remember, Mommie traveled. When I was a baby, she took me with her on the plane: by the age of two, I had traveled to Detroit, Las Vegas, and Chicago-I had baby-sized spoons and forks and souvenirs. Once I was able to walk, she would announce she had an audition for an acting job or modeling assignment and, before going, take me to Atlantic City, New Jersey, where she left me with Aunt Peggy and her husband, Uncle Paul.<br><br>"I'm visiting Atlantic City, but I really live in New York," I would tell everyone, with my native New Yorker's air of superiority. Moving back and forth between the small seaside town and the big concrete city, I would compare everything, and everything seemed to lead me back to the contours of my face. My mother's lips were primly thin-she wore the stoic expression of a pilgrim. My mouth was broad; my full lips framed a toothy smile. 'You have your father's mouth," Aunt Peggy said when I asked her why I didn't look like Mommie. She told me not to smile so broadly-it showed my gums to my disadvantage.<br><br>Then I would kneel on a chair in the dining room, balancing my left arm on the credenza against the wall, and look in the large wall mirror. I practiced curbing my smile. Sometimes I made faces at myself and laughed.<br><br>"If Norma doesn't want anybody to know who she is, she better not laugh," Paul commented to Peggy one day in his gravelly voice.<br><br>"That laugh belongs to nobody but Norma."<br><br>Norma was my mother's first name. I wondered how my mother's laugh could come from my mouth, which was more like my father's. It had been so long since I'd seen my father that I no longer remembered him. I wondered why my mother didn't want anyone to know who I was. Peggy and Paul seemed to understand the answers to these questions, but when I asked, they would look aside and say offhandedly, 'Oh, you'll learn when you're older."<br><br>Back in New York, Mommie didn't treat me like a child. When I asked her why my mouth wasn't shaped like her, she paused barely a second before answering, "Well, that's because you're around me all the time, and we spend so much time together." Her explanation made it seem as natural as the fact that we shared square toes.<br><br>She began teaching me how to read tones of voice and hear intent, even when it seemed at odds with what she said. We would often spend the afternoon at the movies, sometimes catching the same movie several days' running, and afterward she explained how actors used their bodies to convey character: the way Loretta Young swept down a flight of stairs like an aristocrat, how Gloria Swanson's Staircase descent at the end of Sunset Boulevard made her seem crazy or Katharine Hepburn's in The Philadelphia Story made her seem like she didn't care about losing her boyfriend, when she really cared a lot. Sunset Boulevard was Mommie's favorite movie; Gigi, with Leslie Caron and Maurice Chevalier, became mine. Although I didn't understand the plots of these movies, Mommie had a talent for choosing the one scene that even a four-year-old could grasp, and at home I played my mother's co-star as we reenacted them.<br><br>My mother told me stories about her life that seemed as fantastic as any movie star's. She told me she was part Indian, the granddaughter of an outlaw who had ridden with Jesse James's gang. She said she had studied acting with Marlon Brando. She said she has been an Olympic swimmer.<br><br>When she told me that her grandpa had performed tricks on horses for Ringling brothers' circus, I thought she was inventing tales; but that one would turn out, like all her stories, to have a strand of truth.<br><br>As a young woman, when telling people the story of my life, I chose my words carefully: "My mother didn't raise me. I was raised in Atlantic City, new jersey."<br><br>Sometimes I'd add, 'I was raised by my father's people"-"father's people" being a deliberately vague description that could mean my father's brother and sister, some cousins, or, more generally, the entire dark-hued nation. Depending on the race of the listener and how complicated I wished to make the tale, I described those who raised me as my father's sister, my godmother, or my guardians. Aunt Peggy, who after all was not really my aunt but the guardian in question, preferred the last, but my tongue always stuck on that word-"guardian"-it made me feel like a character in a Dickens novel.<br><br>In the vernacular of black America, I was 'taken in," or informally adopted.<br><br>My mother and I never talked about her decision, how it affected her, the way she saw me and those who looked like me, or how it affected the way I viewed her and those who looked like her. We tried, several times, but it was too painful. She could not look at me-with my wild Afro, wide hips, and Harlem address-and ignore her Upper West Side apartment with the wraparound balcony, her closets full of designer clothes, or her support for Ronald Reagan.<br><br>Still, we tried.<br><br>"I don't see you as a black woman when I look at you," she protested, almost making me believe her. 'I see you as mine, all mine. I don't see Jimmy in you at all."<br><br>Jimmy. That was my father, James Cross.<br><br>During the thirties and forties, he had made his fame as a comic who danced in a duo called Stump and Stumpy (Jimmy was known as 'Big Stump," although he was barely five-eight). Stump and Stumpy were headlines then, during the height of the Jazz Age, playing houses like the Cotton Cub and the Paramount Theater, places where blacks could dance onstage but couldn't sit in the audience. When television replaced variety shows in the early fifties, my father's career began a slow nosedive.<br><br>My mother had met him backstage at the Paramount in 1949, before television changed the show business forever. She saw a talented comic at the height of his powers, and he saw what he later remembered as the most beautiful woman he had ever laid eyes on. They began a relationship that lasted for five years.<br><br>Aunt Peggy liked to say that she had been the landlord of the apartment where I was conceived, as though she were the biblical Sarah and my mother were some kind of Hagar, but as I figure the dates, my mother was already three months pregnant when she and Jimmy moved into a one-bedroom apartment at 407 North Indiana Avenue, where Peggy, an elementary-school teacher, and Paul, a county clerk, owned a house.<br><br>Jimmy had been appearing at Club Harlem, the premier black nightclub in Atlantic City, for the summer season, and Mommie and Peggy became friendly. After my parents moved out, and as their relationship went downhill, Mommie began leaving me with Peggy and Paul. These visits got longer and longer, the tell me, until the summer before I started school, she left me there for good.<br><br>That year and the four or five that followed were erased from my memory for a long time. When I asked how I came to live in Atlantic City, Aunt Peggy and Mommie stuck to the same story-they said it had been done gradually, so that I would never know what was going on.<br><br>But even at four, I knew that something was amiss. I remember the subtle shift of moving from Mommie's world to Aunt Peggy and Uncle Paul's-from what seemed like an unfettered childhood, where I felt treated as an adult and was at the center of attention to a house where children obeyed rules and learned responsibilities. In Atlantic City adults no longer included me in their conversation. If they asked what I thought, it was in a tone reserved for babies. Aunt Peggy and Uncle Paul would sometimes drop their voices low and when I entered the room, looking at me with studied nonchalance and frozen smiles when I asked what they were talking about. <br><br>The hardest thing was adjusting to the food.<br><br>Mommie cooked simply-grilled meat and a steamed vegetable was our usual fare, while Aunt Peggy's food was heavier and spicy. One night she fixed pork chops with string beans for dinner. The meat was overcooked, the flavoring strange, the string beans a pile of mush accompanying a quarter of the plate. Mommie has always said I had to taste everything and show manners when I was a guest. I managed to swallow the meat, but refused the string beans.<br><br>Uncle Paul, his voice cracked by emphysema, ordered me to eat my string beans in his Billy Goat Gruff tone.<br><br>I refused.<br><br>He insisted, and I refused instantly. Aunt Peggy tries to intervene, joking that Uncle Paul has been a corporal in the army and sometimes it seemed he had never left. He cut his hazel eyes at her, warning her to stay out of this. Then he looked at me.<br><br>"You're not leaving this table until you eat your vegetables," he declared.<br><br>"I won't and you can't make me!" I shot back.<br><br>The battles lines had been drawn. They wouldn't let me leave, but I could make dinner unpleasant for them. I scraped the string beans from one side of the plate to the other with my fork while kicking the table underneath with my heavy oxford shoes.<br><br>Finally I was sent upstairs, to my room above the kitchen. Mommie had never made me eat food I didn't want. She would never have banished me from the dinner table. I stomped on the gray linoleum floor, knowing the noise would interrupt Peggy and Paul's dinner.<br><br>I heard murmuring below-Paul wanted to come upstairs, but Peggy was telling him firmly to let me get it out of my system. I would show them. I dragged my desk chair to the top of the stairs and pushed it down. It rattled down the steps with such a ruckus that it startled even me, but when no one came, I picked up the little pink stool from the night table and sent it down to. Then all my dolls. And then my books.<br><br>A nice-nice heap was growing at the front door of the stairs when the phone rang. I could tell from Aunt Peggy's voice after she answered that it was my mother. I redoubled my efforts then, screaming and crying as loud as I could.<br><br>After a while, Aunt Peggy called me to the phone. I pounded down the stairs, grunting and sobbing as I stepped over the pile of furniture on the landing, drooling, my eyes nearly swollen shut from my crying. Taking the phone from Peggy, I poured out the whole story to Mommie. I thought surely she would come on the next bus and save me from these mean people and their nasty food.<br><br>Instead she just listened and then quietly said, "You must do as Peggy tells you."<br><br>I protested, but she repeated herself and she told me to go, immediately, and apologize to Paul. Her quiet voice carried more authority than all of his haranguing. I hung up the phone and did as she said.<br><br>Then Aunt Peggy made me carry everything up the stairs.<br><br>In Aunt Peggy's house, I spent hours on my rocking horse, Harry.<br><br>Harry had been a present to me from my mother's then boyfriend, an Italian janitor from the Bronx. I had named him after the singer Harry Belafonte, whose 1956 Calypso album had just become the first album to sell over a million copies. "Day-O" was one of my favorite songs, not least for its refrain, "Daylight comes and me wan' go home."<br><br>Peggy and Paul had placed Harry opposite the big upholstered chair where Peggy liked to sit while chatting on the phone. I would Pat Harry's neck the way I'd seen the Lone Ranger pat his horse, Silver, on TV, and Harry would come alive. When I spurred his hide, his hollow body answered with a sound as big as the echo across a valley. Away we'd ride, Susannah of the Mounties and Harry, traveling through the Western Territories.<br><br>I imagine that I was a girlish Barbara Stanwyck, chasing the bad guys through...</p><h2>Synthetic Men of Mars (Martian Tales, No. 9)</h2><p>John Carter desperately needed the aid of Barsoom&#39;s greatest scientist.

This new collection brings together selections from a wide variety of English translations of Dante&#39;s poetry including the passionate Vita Nuova and the Commedia - his epic tale of one man&#39;s journey into the after-life. It also includes extracts from a wealth of poems inspired by his work - including Spenser&#39;s Faerie Queen, Milton&#39;s Paradise Lost, Ezra Pound&#39;s Cantos and T. S. Eliot&#39;s The Waste Land. Covering the period from Chaucer to the present day, this is a remarkable exploration of the heritage provided by one of the most inspirational poets of all time.</p><p>Dante Alighieri was born in Florence in 1265. At about twenty he married Gemma Donati, with whom he has three children. He first met Beatrice Portinari in 1274, and when she died in 1290 he sought distraction by studying philosophy and theology and by writing the VITA NUOVA. During this time he became involved in the strife between the Guelfs and the Ghibelines; he became a prominent White Guelf and when the Black Guelfs came to power in 1302 Dante, during an absence from Florence, was condemned to exile. He took refuge first in Verona and after wandering from place to place, he settled in Ravenna. While there he completed THE DIVINE COMEDY, which he had begun in 1308. He died in Ravenna in 1321. Eric Griffiths is Fellow in English at Trinity College, Cambridge and works principally on English poetry from the Restoration to the present day; with an interest in comparative literature (French, German, and Italian) and in philosophical and theological aspects of writing (he has published on Newman and Wittgenstein).

James Lake Jr. blinked his eyes open slowly, still remembering his strange dream. He was surrounded by thousands of disassembled Vespa scooter parts without instructions or anyone around to help him put it all back together. And Jim had this feeling that carried over from the dream into the morning&#x2014;a dreadful sense that time was running out. Looking at the alarm clock didn&#x2019;t help the feeling go away.<br> <br>Dressing and combing his black hair in a hurry, Jim went downstairs into the kitchen and started cooking three meals at once: buttered toast for himself (a simple but oh-so-satisfying breakfast), a chipotle-ketchup-glazed meat loaf baking in the oven, and a caramelized onion and goat cheese omelet. Jim worked his Santoku knife with practiced precision across the cutting board, putting a fine dice on the red onions. And he had enough faded scars on his fingertips to remind him to keep them tucked as he sliced the basil into a chiffonade.<br> <br>Multitasking around the kitchen, Jim pulled the meat loaf from the oven and portioned three slices of it into three separate sandwiches, and folded the omelet effortlessly in the skillet. Not bad for a Tuesday. Now came Jim&#x2019;s favorite part: he washed his knife in the sink and air-dried it by twirling the blade between his fingers.<br> <br>Kids, don&#x2019;t try this at home, Jim thought. Unless your mom works crazy-long hours and you&#x2019;ve gotten totally sick of eating PB and J alone every night.<br> <br>Once he had spun every last drop of moisture off its surface, Jim holstered the Santoku in the knife block, plated the omelet, and carried it upstairs on a tray. He gently opened the door to the second bedroom and found his mom, Barbara, sound asleep in her bed.<br> <br>Jim set the tray down on the night table, gently removed his mom&#x2019;s glasses from her face, and polished them with his sweater before placing them next to the omelet. Seeing her there, looking so peaceful, Jim felt kind of sorry for his mom. She worked so hard at the hospital, actually saving peoples&#x2019; lives, and providing for the two of them. Jim vowed long ago never to complain about making meals. It was the least he could do to help his mom out. That, and she was also a really terrible cook.<br> <br>&#x201c;Love you, Mom,&#x201d; Jim said softly as he kissed her on the head and went back downstairs.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>The garage door cranked open mechanically, and Jim walked his bike outside, squinting against the brilliant sunlight.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re late for school, Jimbo,&#x201d; called a familiar voice.<br> <br>Jim smiled when he saw Toby Domzalski waiting for him at the end of the driveway. Tobes was trying to stuff his head into a bike helmet that he had long since outgrown.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry, Tobes,&#x201d; said Jim. &#x201c;Busy with the lunches. One for me, one for Mom, and . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Jim held out a brown paper bag, and Toby eagerly snatched it, inhaling deeply.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; Toby sighed. &#x201c;Balsamic mushrooms, meat loaf&#x2014;chunky&#x2014;sun-dried tomatoes . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Toby&#x2019;s braces shined in the sunlight as he rolled his tongue inside his mouth, trying to place that last flavor he was smelling.<br> <br>&#x201c;And cardamom,&#x201d; said Jim.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ooh, taking a chance there, Chef Jim!&#x201d; Toby replied.<br> <br>Jim smiled. Ever since kindergarten, Toby had always had, well, an appreciation for food. Toby loved the way Jim used equal parts ground beef and pork to keep his meat loaf tender, and Jim loved how Toby loved stuff like that.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s life without a little adventure?&#x201d; joked Jim as he hopped onto his bike.<br> <br>Toby did the same (after a few failed attempts), and the guys pedaled their way to school. Since they were running late, they cut through the woods toward the canal to save five minutes. Toby complained about the bumpy ride, but Jim couldn&#x2019;t help but tune him out a bit and savor the ride. He lived for moments like these&#x2014;racing against the clock, feeling the wind against his face, and jumping his bike over a hill whenever he got a chance.<br> <br>Those little thrills kept Jim focused on the moment and not worried about the day ahead. The idea of sitting through a bunch of classes he was not particularly good at, all while trying not to stare at the amazing girl who didn&#x2019;t even know he existed, made Jim&#x2019;s stomach twist. He wondered how long he would feel this way. How long he would just be so . . . ordinary. All through high school? College? That sensation of time running out returned to Jim, sending a fresh pang of worry to his gut.<br> <br>Oh well, Jim thought as Toby blabbed on behind him. Claire Nu�ez may never notice me, but at least I&#x2019;ve got Tobes. And my mom. And a promising career making sandwiches, I guess. Meat loaf is great and all, but still.

Psychiatrists have only recently acknowledged the role that spirituality plays in their patients' worlds, adding a new category-"the religious or spiritual problem"-to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 1994. Some psychiatrists now specialize in treating the spiritually disturbed, yielding case studies of religious ideation worthy of Oliver Sacks. Journalist Russell Shorto investigates this new science of the soul, examining cutting-edge issues of chemistry and consciousness, and whether psycho-pharmacology has a spiritual component. At the same time, he explores curious byways of the phenomenon such as "Christian psychiatry" and alien abduction, and follows a clergyman who goes "with" the spiritually disturbed on their psychotic journeys. In this moving and impeccably researched narrative, he brings to life two distinct and provocative-and now intertwined-efforts to probe the deepest meaning of human existence.<br><br></p><p>Many people who experience psychotic episodes have extreme spiritual encounters: for one person, it may be a sense of a tree's spirit speaking its truth aloud; for others, it could be the sensation of energy beaming from their bodies and communicating with dolphins on a far-off coast. Modern psychiatry usually categorizes these visions as evidence of psychosis, to be treated with antipsychotic medication. But what if these visions were actually extensions of legitimate spiritual encounters or glimpses into the deeper dimensions of the soul? <p> Author Russell Shorto (<i>Gospel Truth</i>) dares to ask these questions. He even offers evidence of a new movement in psychiatry, in which established doctors are assuming a more holistic approach to psychotic episodes and taking the patient's soul into account. This is not a cavalier dismissal of all that can be gained from appropriate diagnoses of (and medications for) mental illness; rather, it is an impressively researched argument for opening up to the idea of spiritual visions. Citing extensive research and numerous case studies, Shorto helps readers consider the possibility that grandiose spiritual visions aren't necessarily symptoms of mental illness. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><br>Russell Shorto is the author of Gospel Truth: The New Image of Jesus Emerging from Science and History.

Kirk and his crew have preserved the struggling Federation colony on Belle Terre, but their heroic efforts may have been in vain. In a last-ditch attempt to drive the entrenched settlers off their new home, the alien species Kauld have contaminated the planet&#x2019;s atmosphere with a destructive biochemical agent that will soon render the entire world uninhabitable to human life. With only weeks to spare, Spock races to find a scientific solution to their dire predicament, while Kirk takes the battle to the enemy, determined to wrest the secret of their salvation from the very forces out to destroy the future of this new Earth.</p><p>Considered one of the most prolific writers working in modern fiction, <i>USA TODAY</i> bestselling writer, Dean Wesley Smith published far over a hundred novels in forty years, and hundreds of short stories across many genres. He currently produces novels in four major series, including the time travel Thunder Mountain novels set in the old west, the galaxy-spanning Seeders Universe series, the urban fantasy Ghost of a Chance series, and the superhero series staring Poker Boy. During his career he also wrote a couple dozen Star Trek novels, the only two original Men in Black novels, Spider-Man and X-Men novels, plus novels set in gaming and television worlds.<b>Chapter One</b><br><br>The clear canister sitting on the <i>Enterprise</i> science lab bench held no more than a few handfuls of brown soil, taken directly from a field just outside of Belle Terre's main colony on the island side of the planet. It was farm soil, nothing more. Recently tilled, the soil smelled of rich possibilities, seasons full of fresh, crisp vegetables, and the very future of Belle Terre.<br><br>Only there was something very wrong with this soil. And Spock was trying to figure out exactly what that was.<br><br>On the counter beside the canister were almost two dozen other canisters, all containing soil from different areas of Belle Terre. The soil from the explosion-blasted side of the planet seemed darker, almost black with the radiation damage from what the colonists were calling "the Burn." Two canisters seemed almost to be full of light sand.<br><br>But, from what Spock had been told, areas of soil around the planet were "going bad," as the colonists put it. Plants were dying, and in places the soil even smelled foul and rotten. Lilian Coates had asked Captain Kirk to look into it, and the captain had assigned Spock to help the colonist scientists discover what was wrong.<br><br>All the soil canisters in the lab were carefully labeled and sorted by region and continent. It had taken three <i>Enterprise</i> crew members most of a day to collect all of them for Spock. And he had spent the last two hours analyzing the data from scans of each sample. His findings had not been what he had expected. The soil contained polymers that just didn't belong logically on Belle Terre, let alone in every sample from every region of the planet.<br><br>Spock held his tricorder over the sample of rich soil from the largest island on the undamaged side of Belle Terre, then inserted a small silver probe into the soil. He again checked the readings of the soil, then stepped back and flipped a switch on a nearby panel, sending a slight jolt of electricity into the soil through the probe. What he had expected from his readings was a small puff of smoke as the electrical jolt broke down unknown gel molecules he had discovered in the soil.<br><br>That wasn't want he got.<br><br>The soil sample exploded with the force of a large bomb.<br><br>The impact smashed Spock back against the wall, knocking the wind from him. The room swirled with smoke and Spock's ears rang. He could feel a dozen cuts and gashes on his body from flying glass and debris.<br><br>He ignored the wounds, the shortness of breath, and his damaged ears and forced his attention completely on the explosion. He had not expected it, and did not know why it had happened. Simple farming soil did not normally explode when touched with electricity. Clearly the soil problem developing on Belle Terre was far worse than he had first thought.<br><br>Alarm bells were sounding throughout the ship as he slowly stood.<br><br>"Spock! Spock! Come in." Captain Kirk's voice carried over the alarms.<br><br>Spock stumbled a few steps through the glass and debris, and tapped the comm link on the wall. "Spock here, Captain." His own voice sounded hollow and distant in his ears, and he had to lean against the wall for support.<br><br>The captain's voice came back instantly. "Spock, what happened? Are you all right?"<br><br>Spock looked through the smoke at the completely destroyed science lab, then said, "I fared better than the science lab. And I made a discovery."<br><br>"What?" Kirk demanded as two emergency personnel shoved the jammed door aside and rushed into the lab. They stopped, clearly stunned at the destruction; then one moved toward him as the other moved to stop the small fire in a panel.<br><br>Spock understood the men's reaction. He was surprised as well by the force of the explosion. He had grossly miscalculated and it had cost them a lot of important scientific equipment. It was equipment that would not be easily replaced this far from Federation space. It was also lucky that he had been the only person in the lab at the time. A human would have had little chance of surviving such an explosion.<br><br>At that moment Dr. McCoy shoved in through the half-open door and glanced around. "For the love of -- " He instantly moved toward Spock, his medical tricorder in his hand. "What in green-blooded blazes have you done?"<br><br>"Spock?" Kirk demanded over the comm as McCoy scanned him. "What discovery?"<br><br>"Belle Terre is in trouble, Captain," Spock said.<br><br>"Explain," Kirk said.<br><br>"Jim," McCoy said to the comm unit on the wall before Spock could say a word, "if you want to talk to your first officer, it's going to have to be in sickbay."<br><br>McCoy waved over the two emergency crewmen to help him with Spock.<br><br>"I can walk, Doctor," Spock said, pushing himself away from the wall.<br><br>"I doubt that," McCoy said, his voice not hiding his disgust. "But you are more than welcome to try."<br><br>Three stumbling, painful steps later Spock realized the logical choice was to have help getting to sickbay. In fact, it was the only choice.<br><br>Spock was thankful that McCoy had the good sense not to say "I told you so."<br><br>Lilian Coates awoke with a start, gasping for air, sweat dripping from her forehead, her hair stuck to her cheeks. What an awful nightmare.<br><br>She looked around her bedroom, trying to get something familiar back while forcing herself to take a few deep breaths. That was the worst dream she had had since right after the Burn. For the weeks after that she had dreamed she was back in the cave with the children, trying to save them, but always failing. Luckily, in real life, she had been successful. She, her son, Reynold, and five other children had ridden through the explosion of the planet's olivium-filled moon inside a cave. After a month or so the nightmares of Reynold dying, just as her husband had done, ended. But the memory of them always seemed just below the surface of every minute of every day.<br><br>She took another long, deep breath and blew outward, letting the fresh air clear her mind. Then she swung out of bed and in the faint light she padded to Reynold's room, glancing in at him. Their cat, Nova, a gift from Dr. McCoy, lay curled around Reynold's feet. Both seemed to be sleeping fine, so she moved on into the kitchen area, trying not to think about the nightmare until she calmed down some.<br><br>A large glass of cold water helped and she sat at the kitchen table still cluttered with a few dishes left from last night's dinner with Reynold and Captain Kirk. Jim had returned to his ship shortly after dinner and she just hadn't felt like cleaning up. Right now she wished he were here. Someone to talk to, someone to tell her that staying on Belle Terre, not going back to Earth, was the right thing to do for her and Reynold.<br><br>Slowly she let the nightmare back into her thoughts.<br><br><i>She is outside, standing in her garden, under clear, sunny skies. Around her all her plants are dead and wilted. Suddenly her feet become rooted to the soil, as if she is a plant as well.<br><br>She can't move.<br><br>Then she feels pressure around her face, as if someone is putting a hand over her nose and mouth, choking off her air. But there is no one there.<br><br>She can't run.<br><br>She can't breathe.<br><br>She is dying, just as her garden is dying.<br><br>Reynold is beside her, also planted, also unable to breathe.<br><br>She can't save him either.</i><br><br>She knew they were about to suffocate when she awoke.<br><br>Awful nightmare.<br><br>Another long drink of water pushed the images back again. It seemed she was more worried about her garden, and other plants around the area, than she had even told Jim. No doubt the plants dying had something to do with the Burn and the extreme changes in climate and weather. She knew there was a logical explanation for it.<br><br>But it seemed her subconscious didn't.<br><br>She glanced at the time. Two hours until she and Reynold had to be up. There wasn't going to be any getting back to sleep now. Not after that nightmare. She stood and picked up the last of the dishes from last night's dinner and moved to the sink, where she could wash them.<br><br>She was the school administrator for the colony and librarian. She had more than enough work to keep her busy.<br><br>Two hours later, as she fixed her and Reynold's breakfast, the nightmare still haunted her, like a shadow she didn't want.<br><br>And looking at the slowly wilting plants in her garden as she and Reynold headed off to school, she knew that part of the nightmare was truth. The question that worried her was, <i>Which part?</i><br><br>Governor Pardonnet smiled at Tegan Welch as if she were a child, giving her his best false smile. She desperately wanted to smash it into his face. It was that smile that had at first convinced her to trust the man, to follow him for light-years to this planet. And it was that smile that was condemning her son, Charles, to death.<br><br>She was a short woman, at best five feet one inch tall, but she knew how to fight and defend herself and her son. She stepped right up close to him, staring up into his face, forcing him to step backward in the tight space of the medical lab. "Take a look in that room again, Governor." She pointed to a closed door. "My son and four others are going to die unless you get us back to Federation space."<br><br>"I understand that, Ms. Welch," Pardonnet said, trying to ease sideways from where she had him pinned against a medical stand. The small medical supply room was no bigger than a closet. It was where she had asked for a word privately with him the minute they learned the cause of the illness her son and the others were suffering from.<br><br>"So what ship are you planning to send and when?"<br><br>"We're going to get them to the hospital ship first," Pardonnet said, "now that we know the cause of their illness."<br><br>She shook her head. "Not enough and you know it."<br><br>All the doctors, including Dr. McCoy from the <i>Enterprise,</i> had been clear that the only way to save these people was to get them a long distance away from olivium and the subspace radiation it was emitting. After the explosion of the Quake Moon, olivium had pelted the planet and spread like a wave through the system. Her son and the four others were allergic to the standard radiation treatments -- and all the others McCoy had been able to whip up. Deathly allergic.<br><br>Her son would die unless he was away from the olivium and she was going to make sure he got away from it, one way or another.<br><br>"We don't know that getting them to the medical ship won't be enough," Pardonnet said, anger in his voice as he pushed passed her, trying to get to the door. She moved to block his way.<br><br>Pardonnet stopped and stared at her. "Ms. Welch, getting your son out of the atmosphere might stop the spread of the reaction. On the medical ship we can get him and the others into a sterile, protected ward."<br><br>"And what exactly did Dr. McCoy say about that idea?" she asked.<br><br>Pardonnet stared and said nothing.<br><br>"It seems I remember him saying along the lines of 'That would work when pigs fly.' Am I correct?"<br><br>"Dr. McCoy can be wrong," Pardonnet said. "We're going to try it first, then face the next step."<br><br>"My son and the others' lives are not worth a ship to you, are they?"<br><br>Pardonnet actually looked stunned at the accusation; then his eyes hardened and he said, "I have sixty thousand lives to worry about every minute of every day. Now excuse me." He shoved past her and out into the ward.<br><br>She had been right. Five lives were not worth a ship to the governor.<br><br>She stood staring at the medical supplies for a moment. Somehow there had to be a way to get her son out of the deadly poison from the olivium and, ideally, back to Federation space. But just away from the olivium first.<br><br>And if there was a way, she was going to find it. The first step was getting Charles off the planet and to the hospital ship. From there she'd figure out what to do. If it meant stealing a ship and flying it herself, she'd do it. She just hoped it wouldn't come to that.<br><br>But if it did, she wouldn't hesitate.<br><br>Copyright � 2000 by Paramount Pictures</p><h2>Our Sacred Honor: Words of Advice from the Founders in Stories, Letters, Poems, and Speeches</h2><p>Millions of American families have turned to &#34;The Book of Virtues&#34; and &#34;The Moral Compass&#34; by William J.

Nothing, it seems, could be more fundamental to Americans than the protection of these rights. We are all well aware of them, and these days not shy about asserting them. However, few Americans pay enough attention to the last line of the Declaration of Independence. There Jefferson wrote: "we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor." These are not empty words; they are as important as the opening paragraphs of the Declaration. Rights are important. But just as we have a fair claim on our rights, so America's honor&#x2014;our sacred honor&#x2014;has a fair claim on us. The fifty-six men who signed the Declaration of Independence and the other leaders of the American Revolutionary War would either become glorious Founders of a new nation or they would swing from the gallows. As Benjamin Rush said, his fellow signers knew they were signing their own "death warrants."</p><p> Most of the signers of the Declaration as well as other Americans at the time suffered for their devotion to the cause of independence&#x2014;many had to flee their homes; some lost their property and their fortunes, which they and their families never recovered. A few joined the Continental army. One of the sentiments that moved them to make these sacrifices was patriotism.</p><p>Patriotism means love of country, and it can call for great sacrifices and courage, perhaps even for the sacrifice of one's own life. Most of us don't have as keen a sense of that now as did the Founders. Though the word patriotism, from the Latin <i>pater</i> for "father," implies a familial connection, love of country is in fact different from all other attachments. We have natural ties to our families, and sacrificing for loved ones is something each of us does every day. But sacrificing for our country requires a commitment to something more abstract and distant. It requires that we sacrifice our self-interest and private attachments for the sake of the common interest and public good for people we have never seen, for those who have gone before and for those who will come after us. And in America, what brings forth our patriotism&#x2014;our greatest sacrifices&#x2014;is our steadfast devotion to the ideals of freedom and equality. American patriotism, in short, is not based on tribe or family, but on principle, law, and liberty.</p><p> What makes the patriots of 1776 and 1787 so remarkable is that they were devoting themselves to something quite new&#x2014;a new nation conceived in a new way and dedicated to a self-evident truth that all men are created equal. It was of course not easy, they wrote in the Declaration of Independence, to ignore the "ties of our common kindred"&#x2014;their "British brethren." The bonds of "consanguinity" are strong, and most nations are held together by the ties of blood or common ethnicity alone. But these patriots had a new idea&#x2014;a country tied together in loyalty to a principle. The universality of this principle caught fire and inspired a diverse group of men, women, Northerners, Southerners, even European nobility to make great sacrifices for the cause.</p><p>The founding was the product of "reflection" and "choice," as Alexander Hamilton would later put it. But it also took a long and grueling war to make independence a reality, a war led by the father of our country, George Washington. Our most prominent patriot, Washington once wrote that "when my country demands the sacrifice, personal ease must always be a secondary consideration." And he meant it and continued to serve his country despite his preference for private life. This chapter includes many accounts of Washington's unparalleled example of love of country and courage. It also includes accounts of some of our soldiers in action, such as Nathan Hale and Israel Putnam.</p><p> But other patriots, like James Madison, John Adams, or Thomas Jefferson, fought their battles with the pen, not the sword. These men, as has been said, were our Solon and Lycurgus&#x2014;that is, our lawgivers. Madison himself saw the parallels&#x2014;in <i>Federalist 38</i> he wrote that the Constitution provides the possibility for "immortality, as Lycurgus gave to that of Sparta." They seized the opportunity to found a nation on a humane and just foundation. As John Adams put it in his <i>Thoughts on Government:</i></p><p></p><blockquote>You and I, my dear friend, have been sent into life at a time when the greatest lawgivers of antiquity would have wished to live. How few of the human race have ever enjoyed an opportunity of making an election of government, more than of air, soil, or climate, for themselves or their children! When, before the present epocha, had three millions of people full power and a fair opportunity to form and establish the wisest and happiest government that human wisdom can contrive?</blockquote><p> It must be said that the patriots of 1776 and 1787 were not acting completely out of a sense of disinterestedness. Their love of country, as the late historian Douglass Adair has shown, was buttressed, among other things, by what some may say is a more selfish passion&#x2014;the love of fame and glory. This passion for fame or glory, in addition to their love of country, motivated the exertions of our patriots. In the <i>Federalist 72</i> Hamilton wrote that "the love of fame, the ruling passion of the noblest minds...prompt[s] a man to plan and undertake extensive and arduous enterprises for the public benefit." These men acted with their eyes toward posterity, concerned with how they would be remembered and immortalized. These concerns and passions may have been selfish in origin, but they elevated and strengthened the Founders' sense of public duty and gave rise to the "noblest" actions as well. Their love of glory stirred great, not petty, ambitions&#x2014;ambitions which shaped their character and directed them to the political and national stage.</p><p> Adams endured long separations from his wife and family to participate in the Second Continental Congress, where he successfully urged his fellow delegates to adopt the resolution for independence. In Congress, Adams worked fifteen-hour days; as he told Mercy Warren, his schedule was to work "from seven to ten in the morning in the committee; from ten to four in Congress, and from six to ten again in committee." Like Adams, Thomas Jefferson left behind his beloved wife, who was often in frail health, to serve in Congress, where he wrote the Declaration of Independence, the "sheet anchor" of our liberties as Lincoln would later put it. Adams and Jefferson were family men&#x2014;Jefferson was practically a newlywed when he served in Congress&#x2014;yet they balanced their love of the private with a noble love of the <i>res publica</i>&#x2014;" public things." James Madison worked day and night to restructure America's political institutions on a more lasting foundation than the republics of old. Madison later confided to a friend that his efforts at the Constitutional Convention "nearly killed me."</p><p> Abigail Adams noted the particularly difficult requirements patriotism exacted from women. And she observed that the sacrifices of women are no less than the most heroic of men. She was a woman of courage, who held down a farm by herself and took care of four children through the roar of nearby gunfire and a plague of dysentery.</p><p>Times of war and crisis reveal the character of patriotism in high relief. But patriotism is an everyday virtue as well&#x2014;a virtue that cannot be neglected or taken for granted. It requires education; it must be taught; and it must be, as Washington once said, supplemented by our self interest. How is it that sacrifice becomes mixed with self-interest? According to Washington, once we appreciate how our own well-being, prosperity, and liberties are all the products of living in this country, as opposed to any other, we will become natural patriots. Our defense of principle becomes a defense of hearth and home.</p><p>Let me close with the reflections of Washington to Jefferson, a decade after American independence was declared, recalling the veterans of 1776 who had recently died: "Thus some of the pillars of the revolution fall. Others are mouldering by insensible degrees. May our Country never want props to support the glorious fabrick!" That is not a bad fate for each of us to contemplate&#x2014;to spend at least a little of our lives as a "prop" for the greatest country the world has ever seen.</p><p>Copyright � 1997 by William J.

He is the author of <i>The Lucifer Code</i>. Brokaw has had a rich and varied life, and is fascinated by history, human accomplishment, archeology, and the possibilities of just what treasures might be buried beneath the earth.</p><p>Feeling as though someone was pulling a fast one on him, Lourds examined the writing more closely, thinking perhaps it had been inscribed recently upon an ancient bell &#x2013; which would have been foolish under the circumstances because such an act would have destroyed the bell&#x2019;s huge intrinsic value &#x2013; to fool him. If it was a forgery, it was a masterpiece. The inscription felt smooth to the touch. In places it was even worn to the point that it was almost faded.</p><p>Yep. If it was a fake, it was a damned good one.</p><p>Operating by instinct, Lourds reached into his backpack, which was beside his chair, and took out a soft graphite pencil and a tablet containing sheets of onion skin tracing paper. Placing a sheet of paper on the bell, he rubbed the pencil against the surface, creating a negative image of the inscription.</p><p>&#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; Neil asked.</p><p>Lourds ignored the question, consumed by the puzzle that was before him. He took a small digital camera from his backpack and took pictures of the bell from all sides. The camera&#x2019;s flash, especially when used on smooth ceramic, didn&#x2019;t always allow the image to pick up shallow markings. That&#x2019;s why he&#x2019;d done the rubbings.</p><p>He was engrossed. He didn&#x2019;t even notice when Leslie approached and stood on the other side of the desk.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d; Leslie asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Where did you get this?&#x201d; Lourds asked, turning the bell in his hands. The clapper pinged softly against the side.</p><p>&#x201c;From a shop.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What shop?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;An antiquities shop. His father&#x2019;s shop.&#x201d; Leslie nodded toward the man standing against the wall. The man looked a little worried.</p><p>Lourds pinned the man with his gaze, not wishing to be trifled with. If that&#x2019;s what this was, of course. He was halfway convinced that this wasn&#x2019;t a joke. It felt far too elaborate. The bell felt real.</p><p>&#x201c;Where did this come from?&#x201d; Lourds asked in Arabic.</p><p>&#x201c;From my father, sir,&#x201d; the man said politely. &#x201c;The young lady requested that we put something old in with the other items. To better test you, she said. My father and I told her we could not read what was written on the bell either, so we didn&#x2019;t know what it said.&#x201d; He hesitated. &#x201c;The young woman said this was all right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where did your father get this bell?&#x201d;</p><p>The man shook his head. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. It&#x2019;s been in his shop for years. He tells me that no one seems to be able to tell him what it is.&#x201d;</p><p>Lourds switched back to English and looked at Leslie. &#x201c;I want to talk to his father. See the shop where this bell came from.&#x201d;</p><p>Leslie looked surprised. &#x201c;All right. I&#x2019;m sure we can arrange that. What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t read this.&#x201d; Lourds looked at the bell again, still not believing what he knew to be true.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; Leslie told him. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think anyone&#x2019;s really going to believe that you can read all those languages. You knew a lot of others. The people who watch our show will still be impressed. I&#x2019;m impressed.&#x201d;</p><p>Lourds told himself to be patient. Leslie truly didn&#x2019;t understand the problem.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m an authority in the languages spoken here,&#x201d; he told her. &#x201c;Civilization as we know it began not far from here. The languages used here, living and dead, are as familiar to me as my own hand. Given that, this writing should be in one of the Altaic languages. Turkic, Mongolic or Tungusic.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid I don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re talking about.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a family of languages,&#x201d; Lourds explained, &#x201c;that encompassed this area. It&#x2019;s where all language here sprang from. Although the subject is hotly contested by linguists. Some linguists believe the Altaic language resulted from a genetically inherited language, words and ideas &#x2013; and perhaps even symbols &#x2013; that are written somewhere in our genetic code.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Genetics predisposes language?&#x201d; Leslie arched a narrow eyebrow in surprise. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never heard of anything like that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nor should you. I don&#x2019;t believe it&#x2019;s true. There&#x2019;s another, more simplistic reason why so many languages at the time shared common traits.&#x201d; Lourds calmed himself. &#x201c;All those people, with all their different languages, lived in close proximity. They traded with one another, all of them in pursuit of the same things. They had to have common words in order to do that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sort of like the computer explosion and the Internet,&#x201d; Leslie said. &#x201c;Most of the computer terms are in English since the United States developed much of the technology, and other countries simply used the English words because they had no words in their own language to describe the computer parts and terminology.&#x201d;</p><p>Lourds smiled. &#x201c;Exactly. A very good analogy, by the way.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That theory is called the Sprachbund.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What is the Sprachbund?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the convergence area for a group of people who ultimately end up partially sharing a language. When the Crusades took place, during the battles between the Christians and the Muslims, language and ideas were traded back and forth as much as arrows and sword blows. Those wars were as much about expanding trade as they were about securing the Holy Land.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re telling me that they ended up speaking each others&#x2019; language.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The people that fought or traded, yes. Bits of it. We still carry the history of that conflict in words of modern English. Words like assassin, azimuth, cotton, even the words cipher and decipher. They come from the Arabic word sifi, which is the number zero. The symbol for zero was central to many codes. But this artifact shares nothing with the native languages of this area&#x2014;or with any language I&#x2019;ve ever heard or seen.&#x201d; Lourds held up the bell. &#x201c;In those early years, craftsmen &#x2013; especially craftsmen who wrote and kept records &#x2013; would be part of that Sprachbund. That&#x2019;s a logical assumption. But this bell &#x2013; ?&#x201d; He shook his head. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s an anomaly. I don&#x2019;t know where it came from. If it&#x2019;s not a forgery, and it doesn&#x2019;t feel like one, what we&#x2019;re looking at is an artifact from some other place than the Middle East.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What other place?&#x201d;</p><p>Lourds sighed. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the problem. I don&#x2019;t know. And I should know that as well.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You think we have a real find here, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Excitement gleamed in Leslie&#x2019;s eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;A find,&#x201d; Lourds agreed tentatively, &#x201c;or an aberration.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The inscription on that bell could be...humbug, for lack of a better term. Simply nonsense made up to decorate the bell.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t you know, if that were the case? Wouldn&#x2019;t it be easy to spot?&#x201d;</p><p>Lourds frowned. She had him there. Even an artificial language would require a basis in logic. As such, he should be able to spot that as well.</p><p>&#x201c;Well?&#x201d; she pressed.</p><p>&#x201c;I should be able to tell. This looks authentic to me.&#x201d;</p><p>Leslie smiled again and leaned toward the bell, regarding it with intensity. &#x201c;If that&#x2019;s truly written in a heretofore undiscovered language, then we&#x2019;ve truly made an astonishing find.&#x201d;</p><p>Before Lourds could respond, the door suddenly ripped from its hinges. Armed men burst into the room, aiming their weapons at the people inside.</p><p>&#x201c;Everybody freeze!&#x201d; a man yelled in accented English.</p><p>Everybody froze.</p><p>Lourds thought he recognized an Italian accent in the man&#x2019;s words.</p><p>The four armed men pressed into the room. They used their fists and their weapons to drive the whole television crew to the floor. All of Leslie&#x2019;s people cowered there and remained still.</p><p>One of the men, the one who had spoken, crossed the room in long strides and grabbed Leslie by the arm.</p><p>Lourds stood instinctively, not able to calmly sit by and watch the young woman get hurt. But he wasn&#x2019;t trained for this kind of thing. Sure, he&#x2019;d spent time in rough parts of the world. But he&#x2019;d been lucky. The worst violence he&#x2019;d ever experienced personally was a dust-up in soccer.</p><p>The man put the machine pistol&#x2019;s barrel to Leslie&#x2019;s head. &#x201c;Sit back down, Professor Lourds, or this pretty young woman dies.&#x201d;</p><p>Lourds sat, but the fact that the man knew his name unnerved him.</p><p>&#x201c;Very good,&#x201d; the man said. &#x201c;Put your hands on your head.&#x201d;</p><p>Lourds complied. His stomach turned sour. Even as wild as it had sometimes gotten while he&#x2019;d been in unsettled lands studying languages, he&#x2019;d never had a gun pointed at him.</p><p>&#x201c;Down,&#x201d; the man ordered, dragging Leslie to the ground. When she was down, the man looked at the items on the desk. Without hesitation, he took the bell.</p><p>And that&#x2019;s when the man hade his first mistake. He and his men took their eyes off Leslie.</p><p>Before Lourds fully realized what was happening, she pushed herself to her feet and flung herself at one of the men. She knocked him over and took his gun, then dived beneath the heavy desk at the back of the set in a single fluid motion.</p><p>Her move took the thieves by surprise. Clearly they weren&#x2019;t expecting a mere woman to put up much of a fight.</p><p>They had underestimated her, but they were clearly professional because it didn&#x2019;t take long for them to catch up.</p><p>The sounds of gunfire filled the room as that desk took punishment it was never intended for. ...</p></p><h2>The early liturgy to the time of Gregory the Great</h2><p>314p paperback with red card cover, bright fresh copy, hardly used, pages clean and binding tight</p><p></p><h2>Alfred's Teach Yourself to Sing: Everything you need to know to start singing now!, Book &amp; Enhanced CD (Teach Yourself Series)</h2><p>Learn to sing and open up a brand new world of musical knowledge with this exciting method from Alfred.

When another body turns up, Hanne realizes that time is running out, and she must act fast before panic takes over. Complicating things is the presence of a mysterious guest, who had travelled in a private rail car at the end of the train and was evacuated first to the top floor of the hotel. No one knows who the guest is, or why armed guards are needed, but it is making everyone uneasy. Hanne has her suspicions, but she keeps them to herself. <br><br>Trapped in her wheelchair, trapped by the storm, and now trapped with a killer, Hanne must fit the pieces of the puzzle together before the killer strikes again.</p><p>Anne Holt is Norway&#x2019;s bestselling female crime writer. She was a journalist and news anchor and spent two years working for the Oslo Police Department before founding her own law firm and serving as Norway&#x2019;s Minister for Justice in 1996 and 1997. Her first novel was published in 1993 and her books have been translated into over thirty languages and have sold more than 7 million copies. Her novel <i>1222</i> was nominated for an Edgar Award for Best Novel. She lives in Oslo with her family.<b>i</b><br> <br>The Crown Princess had been on the train, according to what people were saying.<br> <br>Nobody knew where she had gone.<br> <br>When I insisted on having my wheelchair fetched from the train, it wasn&#x2019;t only because I felt helpless without it. As far as my mobility went, it didn&#x2019;t really make that much difference. I had to stay in the lobby anyway. The toilets were on the same floor right next to the main staircase, which made it possible for me to empty my bags with comparatively little embarrassment, thank God, but apart from that there was nowhere I could get to without help.<br> <br>The most important thing about the wheelchair is that it creates distance.<br> <br>Not physically, of course; as I said, I am constantly stared at and bombarded with offers of help. I strive more for a kind of mental distance. The chair makes me different. It defines me as something completely different from all the rest, and it is not uncommon for people to assume that I am stupid. Or deaf. People talk over my head, quite literally, and if I simply lean back and close my eyes, it&#x2019;s as if I don&#x2019;t exist.<br> <br>You learn a great deal in this way. My relationship to other people is&#x2014;how shall I put it&#x2014;more academic in its nature. I would prefer not to have anything to do with them at all, something that can easily be interpreted as a lack of interest. This is incorrect. People do interest me. That&#x2019;s why I watch a great deal of television. I read books. I have a DVD collection that would be the envy of many. In my day I was a good investigator. One of the best, I would like to think. That would be impossible without a certain curiosity when it comes to other people&#x2019;s stories, other people&#x2019;s lives.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s having people close to me that I find difficult.<br> <br>I am interested in people, but I don&#x2019;t want people to be interested in me. A very taxing situation. At least it is if you surround yourself with friends and colleagues, and if you have to work in a team&#x2014;as you do in the police. When I got shot and almost died, I ran out of strength.<br> <br>I was perfectly happy sitting there, all by myself.<br> <br>People were staring, I could feel it, but it was still as if I didn&#x2019;t exist. They were talking openly about everything. Despite the fact that many had disappeared for a while when the rooms were allocated, it was still too early to wind down for the night. Most of them came back before long. A few were standing chatting in the reception area. The shock of the accident had begun to subside, edging towards laughter. The situation was no longer threatening, in spite of the fact that the storm outside the old hotel was more violent than anything any of us had experienced before. It was more the fact that the shabby, melancholy air of the hotel was having a calming effect on us. Its crooked brown architectural patchwork had withstood both wind and storms for almost a hundred years, and it was not going to let anybody down tonight either. The doctors had worked their way through the queue of those needing help. A few of the teenagers were playing poker. I had positioned my chair at just the right distance from the long wooden table, and I could hear both the youngsters and the stream of people coming back from their rooms to find out the latest news, to compare their injuries, and to stare at the huge windows as the storm tried in vain to batter its way through to us at Finse 1222.<br> <br>I was listening to what people were saying. They thought I was asleep.<br> <br>And now that everyone had been taken care of and fed, when there wasn&#x2019;t much more to say about where exactly they had been on the train when the crash happened, and glasses of red wine and beer had started to appear, most people were more interested in where on earth Mette-Marit had got to.<br> <br>The rumour had already been circulating on the train. Two middle-aged women just behind me had talked about virtually nothing else. There was an extra carriage, they whispered. The last carriage looked different from the rest of the train, and this wasn&#x2019;t the way the normal morning train to Bergen looked at all. What&#x2019;s more, the far end of the platform had been cordoned off. It had to be the Royal Carriage. True, it didn&#x2019;t look particularly royal, but there was no way of knowing how it was equipped inside, and besides it was widely known that Mette-Marit was scared of flying. It could be Sonja, of course; she adores the mountains, I mean everybody knows that, but on the other hand she wouldn&#x2019;t be leaving home right now, just before the King&#x2019;s seventieth birthday.<br> <br>I breathed a huge sigh of relief when the two ladies got off at H�nefoss.<br> <br>I rejoiced too soon.<br> <br>The gossip had caught on, and was well on the way to becoming the truth. Strangers were chatting to each other. The train became less and less Norwegian as it climbed towards the high mountains. People were sharing their sandwiches and fetching coffee for each other. One person thought they knew something they had heard from someone they knew, and a girl of about twenty-five had definitely heard that somebody she went to school with who now worked in the royal protection team was actually going to Bergen this week.<br> <br>When we left Oslo, there was quite simply an extra carriage on the train.<br> <br>By the time we were approaching Finse, the carriage had turned into the Royal Carriage and everybody knew that Mette-Marit and her bodyguards were on board, along with little Prince Sverre, no doubt. He was still so small, after all. He needed his mummy, the little darling. An eager elderly man thought he had seen a little girl through a window before he was brusquely turned away by the police, so Ingrid Alexandra was there too.<br> <br>But where had they gone, all these members of the royal family?<br> <br>Sometimes I realize a little more clearly than usual why I would prefer not to have anything to do with other people.<br> <br><b>ii</b><br> <br>Her voice was characteristic, bordering on parody.<br> <br>It is said that opinions in themselves are never dangerous. I&#x2019;m not so sure.<br> <br>Whether it is Kari Thue&#x2019;s views or her missionary zeal that frighten me most it&#x2019;s difficult to say. At any rate, she is still very adept. She could play the main character in a play by Holberg, with her absurd logic, her way of distorting the facts, and her impressive belief in her own message. Besides which, she has such a bloody high profile. She&#x2019;s everywhere: on the television, on the radio, in the papers. Kari Thue frightens nervous people into becoming aggressive, and seduces otherwise sensible men into insanity. The woman with a voice as sharp as the parting in her thin hair had already started a quarrel. There were two Muslims at Finse this afternoon: a man and a woman. Kari Thue is a bloodhound of note, and she had scented the problem long ago.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not talking to you,&#x201d; she almost screamed, and I just had to open my eyes a fraction. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m talking to her!&#x201d;<br> <br>A short man with an enormous beard was trying to position himself between Kari Thue and a woman to whom he was married, judging by appearances. She was wearing dark, full-length clothes and a headscarf; she was the person the priest had tried to drag along to his prayer meeting in the hobby room, in his confusion. I presumed they were Kurds. They could of course just as easily have been Iranians, Iraqis, or even Italian Muslims, when it came down to it, but I still settled on Kurds. Ever since I got to know Nefis, who is a Turk, I have become pretty good at noticing details that I can&#x2019;t define, strictly speaking, but which means I rarely get it wrong. The woman was weeping, hiding her face in her hands.<br> <br>&#x201c;There, you see!&#x201d; shouted Kari Thue. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>The priest wearing the Brann scarf, who was at least as well known from television as Thue herself, moved towards them.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s all just calm down, shall we,&#x201d; he intoned, placing a calming hand on the shoulder of the agitated Kurdish man. &#x201c;My name is Cato Hammer. We should all be friends and have some consideration for each other in a situation like&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>He ran his other hand down Kari Thue&#x2019;s back. She reacted as if he had been anointing her with sulphuric acid, and turned around so fast that she almost dropped the little rucksack she carried over one shoulder.<br> <br>&#x201c;Get off!&#x201d; she hissed. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t touch me!&#x201d;<br> <br>He removed his hand at once.<br> <br>&#x201c;I really do think you need to calm down a little,&#x201d; he said in a fatherly tone.<br> <br>&#x201c;This has nothing to do with you,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m trying to conduct a conversation with this woman!&#x201d;<br> <br>She was so preoccupied with the genial priest that the Kurd seized his chance. With a firm grip on his wife&#x2019;s arm he hurried away from the reception desk and disappeared in the direction of the stairs, where a sign carved in wood announced that you were now entering St Paal&#x2019;s Bar.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t like priests. I dislike them and imams in equal measure, although I haven&#x2019;t actually come across many of the latter. I did once meet a rabbi who was quite decent, but that was in New York. On the whole I have little time for religion, and particularly for those who act as stewards for various religious beliefs. I find priests the most difficult of all to tolerate. Naturally, they are also the ones I am most accustomed to. And I react against priests like Cato Hammer most strongly of all. They preach a theology of tolerance where the boundaries between right and wrong are so vague that I cannot see the point of having a religion at all. They smile piously and open their arms wide. They love everyone. Sometimes I suspect that priests like Cato Hammer don&#x2019;t believe in God at all. Instead they are in love with a Jesus clich�, the good man in sandals with the velvety gaze and welcoming hands. Suffer little children to come unto me. I just can&#x2019;t cope with it at all. I don&#x2019;t want to be embraced. I want sulphurous sermons and threats of eternal flames. Give me priests and bishops with straight backs and burning eyes, give me implacability and condemnation and promises of punishment on the other side. I want a church that whips its congregation onward along the straight and narrow, and makes it crystal clear to the rest of the world that we are heading for eternal damnation. At least that would make it easy to see the difference between us. And I won&#x2019;t have to feel involved, something I have never asked to be.<br> <br>So I didn&#x2019;t like the man.<br> <br>Without pre-empting events, I would still like to say at this point that the first thing I thought when I heard that Cato Hammer was dead a few hours later was that he hadn&#x2019;t been such a terrible person after all, in spite of everything.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t get so agitated,&#x201d; he said to the raging fury. &#x201c;You create distance between people, Kari Thue. Muslims are not the same as Islamists. The world is not like that. You divide us up into&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Idiot,&#x201d; she snapped. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never said or implied anything of the kind. You&#x2019;ve fallen for the naive Norwegian political correctness that is allowing this country to be invaded by . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>I closed my ears.<br> <br>If religion is, as I believe, basically a scourge for mankind, then I still see no logic, not to mention decency, in arranging believers in some kind of rank order. Religion comprises tyranny and civilization, rejection and conformity, love and oppression. And why Islam in particular should be regarded as worse than other faiths is beyond my comprehension. But it is not beyond Kari Thue&#x2019;s comprehension. She is the leader of a movement that reserves the right to stand up for all women, children, foetuses, and everything else that forms part of &#x201c;Norwegian values.&#x201d;<br> <br>I am allergic to the word &#x201c;values.&#x201d;<br> <br>Combined with the concept &#x201c;Norwegian,&#x201d; it becomes utterly loathsome. In her fanatical desire to strike back at the &#x201c;Islamic world threat,&#x201d; Kari Thue and her increasingly numerous and terrifyingly influential campaigns are making life very difficult for hardworking, well-integrated Norwegian Muslims.<br> <br>The other feeling that struck me several hours later when I heard about the death was therefore a sense of annoyance that it wasn&#x2019;t Kari Thue who was lying there frozen stiff in a snowdrift instead of Cato Hammer.<br> <br>But you can&#x2019;t really say that sort of thing.<br> <br><b>iii</b><br> <br>&#x201c;Are you asleep?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said, trying to sit up straight in my chair. &#x201c;Well, not any more.&#x201d;<br> <br>I was starting to feel stiff. Despite the fact that I couldn&#x2019;t feel the wound in my thigh, it had become clear that the rest of my body had also taken a considerable beating. My back was aching, one shoulder was sore, and my mouth was dry. Dr Streng had pulled up a chair beside me. He offered me a glass of red wine.<br> <br>&#x201c;No thanks. But a glass of water would be great.&#x201d;<br> <br>He disappeared for a couple of minutes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; I said, emptying the glass in one draught.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; said Dr Streng. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s important to take in fluids.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Definitely,&#x201d; I said, smiling stiffly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Terrible weather,&#x201d; he said cheerfully.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t respond to remarks like that.<br> <br>&#x201c;I tried to go out for a while,&#x201d; he went on, unabashed. &#x201c;Just to feel the cold, that&#x2019;s all. It&#x2019;s impossible! It&#x2019;s not just that there&#x2019;s a hurricane blowing, they say the snow is worse than anyone up here has seen before. It&#x2019;s piled high against the walls and windows, and the temperature is down to minus twenty-six, and with the wind-chill factor it&#x2019;s going to feel . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>He thought for a moment.<br> <br>&#x201c;Freezing cold,&#x201d; I suggested.<br> <br>I put the glass down on the floor. Released the brake on my chair and nodded briefly to the doctor before setting off slowly. He didn&#x2019;t take the hint.<br> <br>&#x201c;We can go and sit over here,&#x201d; he suggested, trotting after me with two glasses of red wine in his hands in the hope that I might change my mind. &#x201c;Then we can look at the weather!&#x201d;<br> <br>I gave up and parked by the window as he suggested.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not much to look at,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Whiteness. Ice. Snow.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And wind,&#x201d; said Dr Magnus Streng. &#x201c;Just listen to that wind!&#x201d;<br> <br>He was right there. For one thing, the roaring from outside was so loud that everyone had to raise their voice in order to be heard. What was more remarkable was that the wind was making the windowpanes vibrate, as if the storm were a living thing with a loudly pounding heart. The view was completely devoid of reference points. No trees, no objects, even the walls of the rooms at right angles to reception had disappeared in a whirling chaos of snow, without anything to focus on.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing to worry about,&#x201d; said a voice behind me. &#x201c;Those windows will hold. They&#x2019;re triple-glazed. If one goes, there are still two left.&#x201d;<br> <br>Geir Rugholmen was clearly not a person to hold grudges. He sat down on the edge of the table and raised his glass in a toast. It looked like Coca-Cola.<br> <br>&#x201c;Absolutely,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fascinating,&#x201d; said the doctor happily. &#x201c;These windows aren&#x2019;t quite as big, but in Bl�stuen&#x201d;&#x2014;he was referring to the hotel&#x2019;s common room on the lower floor&#x2014;&#x201c;you really do see the proof that glass is an elastic material. Now, Rugholmen, what can you tell us about these rumours that there&#x2019;s royalty among us?&#x201d;<br> <br>I actually thought I saw a slight shift in the expression on the face of the mountain man. Something watchful, a flicker in his eyes before he sought refuge behind the glass he was holding.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing but talk,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t believe everything you hear.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But that carriage,&#x201d; Magnus Streng protested. &#x201c;There was definitely an extra&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Is everything OK with you?&#x201d; asked Rugholmen, looking at me with a little smile, as if he wanted to draw a line under our earlier discussion.<br> <br>I nodded, then shook my head as Magnus Streng once again offered me the glass of red wine.<br> <br>...</p><h2>Fabulous Felted Scarves: 20 Wearable Works of Art</h2><p>Felting is hotter than ever, and scarves are fabulous first projects for crafters to try.

Sinclair&#x2019;s writing, even at its most poignant or electrifying, blurred the line between politics and art&#x2013;and, indeed, his life followed a similar arc. In<i> Radical Innocent: Upton Sinclair</i>, Anthony Arthur weaves the strands of Sinclair&#x2019;s contentious public career and his often-troubled private life into a compelling personal narrative. <br><br>An unassuming teetotaler with a fiery streak, called a propagandist by some, the most conservative of revolutionaries by others, Sinclair was such a driving force of history that one could easily mistake his life story for historical fiction. He counted dozens of epochal figures as friends or confidants, including Mark Twain, Jack London, Henry Ford, Thomas Mann, H. G. Wells, Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt, Albert Einstein, Charlie Chaplin, Albert Camus, and Carl Jung.<br><br>Starting with <i>The Jungle</i> in 1906, Sinclair&#x2019;s fiction and nonfiction helped to inform and mold American opinions about socialism, labor and industry, religion and philosophy, the excesses of the media, American political isolation and pacifism, civil liberties, and mental and physical health. <br><br>In his later years, Sinclair twice reinvented himself, first as the Democratic candidate for governor of California in 1934, and later, in his sixties and seventies, as a historical novelist. In 1943 he won a Pulitzer Prize for <i>Dragon&#x2019;s Teeth</i>, one of eleven novels featuring super-spy Lanny Budd.<br><br>Outside the literary realm, the ever-restless Sinclair was seemingly everywhere: forming Utopian artists&#x2019; colonies, funding and producing Sergei Eisenstein&#x2019;s film documentaries, and waging consciousness-raising political campaigns. Even when he wasn&#x2019;t involved in progressive causes or counterculture movements, his name often was invoked by them&#x2013;an arrangement that frequently embroiled Sinclair in controversy.<br><br>Sinclair&#x2019;s passion and optimistic zeal inspired America, but privately he could be a frustrated, petty man who connected better with his readers than with members of his own family. His life with his first wife, Meta, his son David, and various friends and professional acquaintances was a web of conflict and strain. Personally and professionally ambitious, Sinclair engaged in financial speculation, although his wealth-generating schemes often benefited his pet causes&#x2013;and he lobbied as tirelessly for professional recognition and awards as he did for government reform. As the tenor of his work would suggest, Sinclair was supremely human.<br><br>In <i>Radical Innocent: Upton Sinclair</i>, Anthony Arthur offers an engrossing and enlightening account of Sinclair&#x2019;s life and the country he helped to transform. Taking readers from the Reconstruction South to the rise of American power to the pinnacle of Hollywood culture to the Civil Rights era, this is historical biography at its entertaining and thought-provoking finest. <br><br>Praise<br>"Lively, unsparing look at the turn-of-the-century muckraker, social critic and novelist who changed the way America did business....Arthur organizes his biography into chapters reflecting Sinclair's various crusading "selves"&#x2014;e.g., <i>The Warrior</i>, <i>The Pilgrim of Love</i>, etc.&#x2014;and uses a deft, light touch...<b>An immensely readable biography."</b>&#x2013; <i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>&#x201c;..excellent new biography.&#x201d;&#x2013; <i>USA Today<br></i>&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;...a model of good biography.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>Los Angeles Magazine</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Absorbing.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>The Wall Street Journal</i><br><br>"intimate and intellectually astute."- <i>The New Yorker</i><br>&#x201c;enlightening, frequently stinging biography . . .

Additionally, he has written <i>Deliverance at Los Ba�os</i> and <i>The Bushmasters</i>, both narrative histories of World War II, and <i>The Tailor-King: The Rise and Fall of the Anabaptist Kingdom of M�nster</i>. A professor emeritus, Arthur retired two years ago from the English department at California State University at Northridge, where he had taught American literature since 1970. He lives in Woodland Hills, California.A hundred years ago, 27-year-old Upton Sinclair became an overnight sensation with the publication of his novel <i>The Jungle,</i> an indictment of the meatpacking industry that would usher in legislation like the Pure Food and Drug Act. The social reformer went on to shock his friends by leaving the American Socialist Party and winning the 1934 Democratic nomination for governor of California, although he lost the election. And at 65, despite a string of failed novels, the resilient author won the 1943 Pulitzer Prize for <i>Dragon's Teeth</i>, the second in an 11-book series of historical novels featuring the hero Lanny Budd. Particularly interesting are the portrayals of Sinclair's friendships with luminaries like President Theodore Roosevelt, Sinclair Lewis and Albert Einstein; his ambitious experiments in communal living; and his shattering divorce from his first wife and estrangement from his son. Also noteworthy are his unsuccessful campaign for the Nobel Prize and his problematic business dealings with Russian film director Sergei Eisenstein. Arthur (<i>Warring with Words: Famous Literary Feuds in America</i>) draws a well-researched, balanced and fascinating portrait of a self-centered feminist who didn't understand women, a muckraker whose na�vet� left him constantly vulnerable to human treachery, and a complex, bestselling celebrity who was often dismissed as a propagandist by the literary establishment. 16 pages of b&amp;w photos not seen by <i>PW</i>. <i>(On sale June 6)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A week before Stalin's death, his final pogrom, "one that would forever rid the Motherland of the vermin," is in full swing. Three government goons arrive in the middle of the night to arrest Solomon Shimonovich Levinson, an actor from the defunct State Jewish Theater.

Evoking the clash of tone and subject found in movies like <i>The Producers</i> and <i>The Great Dictator</i>, <i>The Yid</i> is a screwball farce about atrocity.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Maureen Corrigan, NPR&#x2019;s Fresh Air</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Goldberg has written a book that revolves about Stalin&#x2019;s final blow against the country&#x2019;s remaining Jews.... Mr. Goldberg comes up with a team of Yiddish-speaking jokester-superheroes who are at the heart of his story, and who make it their mission to avenge countless acts of anti-Semitism, both real and anticipated.... <i>The Yid</i> is about Stalin&#x2019;s worst enemy as well as his favorite prey.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Janet Maslin, <i>The New York Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Yid</i> is darkly playful and generous with quick insights into the vast weirdness of its landscape.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Glen David Gold, <i>The Washington Post</i></p><p>&#x201c;This novel&#x2019;s black humor is surpassed only by its historical audacity and literary fearlessness.... If you&#x2019;re looking for the next &#x201c;Catch-22,&#x201d; it may be for you.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Tony Norman, <i>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Yid</i> [is a] rollicking romp of a novel... In something like the mode of writer-director Quentin Tarantino in his films <i>Inglourious Basterds</i> and <i>Django Unchained</i>, Goldberg offers <i>The Yid</i> as a literary score-settling machine: a way for one of history's most brutal villains to receive a kind of cosmic comeuppance at the hands of those he victimized in real life. The difference is that unlike Tarantino, whose revenge fantasies undercut their higher purpose with an excess of sensational violence, Goldberg is less interested in the body than he is in the soul.... <i>The Yid</i> is as hilarious as it is appalling, and vice versa.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Kevin Nance, <i>Chicago Tribune</i></p><p>&#x201c;Wily, rambunctiously entertaining [with] irresistible characters.... Goldberg&#x2019;s rapier-like, galvanizing novel unwinds in three acts punctuated by hilarious, flashing, and slashing dialogue as these rebels of temperaments deliberate and impulsive, skills invaluable and surprising, and memories painful and inspiriting, banter, lewdly insult each other, and argue over Shakespeare, Pushkin, Akhmatova, medical ethics, the broken promise of socialism, anti-Semitism, and racism.... Goldberg deftly presents plays within plays, in which his heroic, smart, acerbic, wildly improvising, cool-under-fire characters use stagecraft to attempt an impossible mission.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Donna Seaman, <i>Booklist</i> (STARRED REVIEW)</p><p>&#x201c;Breathtaking.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;[A] fantastical (and fantastic) debut novel... Highly recommended for readers with a grasp of history who enjoy imaginative deviations from what we think we know as historical truth.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Edward B. Cone, <i>Library Journal</i> (STARRED REVIEW)</p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Yid</i> is a quirky mixture of tones, blending the somber import of Bernard Malamud&#x2019;s <i>The Fixer</i> with the madcap humor of Gary Shteyngart.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Mark Athitakis, <i>Kirkus</i></p><p>&#x201c;A brilliant novel that is at once surreally comic, suspenseful &#x2015; if slightly cracked &#x2015; and punctuated with eruptions of violence, but with a poignant ending.... An extraordinary, rich and surprising tale of intrigue... Paul Goldberg has been aptly compared to a whole constellation of Jewish literary geniuses &#x2015; Sholem Aleichem, Philip Roth, Cynthia Ozick, E.L. Doctorow, Michael Chabon and even the Coen brothers. (I would hasten to add Mordecai Richler to the list.) And <i>The Yid</i> is proof that he surely belongs in their lofty ranks.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Jonathan Kirsch, <i>The Jewish Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;Blending historical figures and the scope of Shakespeare, this is a take on history unlike any other.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<i>Vol.1 Brooklyn</i></p><p>&#x201c;A bizarre and wonderfully discursive novel... a tour de force of riotous humor set in the dark and blood-stained Soviet Union of the 1950s when Stalin&#x2019;s periodic paranoia and murderous anti-Semitism reemerge.... With Kafka, as with more contemporary Jewish writers like Joseph Heller, Michael Chabon and Nathan Englander, we have become familiar with literature that successfully blends murder with mirth, and the hilarious with the horrific.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Gerald Sorin, <i>Haaretz</i></p><p>&#x201c;Goldberg packs layers of meaning and atmosphere into the story, deftly blending humor and horror.... Goldberg&#x2019;s achievement in <i>The Yid</i> transcends the misery and evil he portrays. Just as Shakespeare inserts jesters among the gore of his tragedies, Goldberg has constructed a tragedy instead of a travesty of the human spirit.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Stephanie Shapiro, <i>The Buffalo News</i></p><p>&#x201c;Most fiction and nonfiction accounts of Stalin-era arrests go like this: The secret police come in the night and take the accused away in a Black Maria, to never be seen again. The neighbors sit by quietly, pretending not to have heard a thing. Mr. Goldberg amends this with a very American sensibility, replacing fear and submission with Tarantino-esque swagger.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Anya Ulinich, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;No act of violence, no sacred subject, no reference high or low escapes Goldberg&#x2019;s manic, discursive delight in this novel of an old Jewish stage actor and the unlikely troupe he assembles to assassinate Joseph Stalin.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<i>O, The Oprah Magazine</i></p><p>&#x201c;[A] vivid and whip-smart look at the Cold War and its implications for our world today.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Patrik Henry Bass, <i>Essence</i></p><p>&#x201c;Seriously funny, absurd and violent.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Glenn C. Altschuler, <i>Jerusalem Post</i></p><p>&#x201c;An absorbing historical page-turner that somehow wrings delight from the terrible... Goldberg pushes and pulls history as needed to work his magic.... It&#x2019;s a good story, but what makes this such a terrific book is the author&#x2019;s confident mastery of the world he immerses us in, the fascinating and tragic back stories he weaves with little loss of narrative momentum, and his conspiratorial relationship to the reader....&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Daniel Akst, <i>Newsday</i></p><p>&#x201c;One of the most distinctive and curious aspects of <i>The Yid</i> is its odd balance between seriousness and comedy. Have you had that experience of reading <i>The New Yorker</i>, where you&#x2019;re in the middle of a searing article about, say, Stalin&#x2019;s anti-Semitism, and you&#x2019;re struck by the incongruity of there being a silly little cartoon of a talking dog in the middle of the page? The evocation of that feeling seems to be not just a major characteristic of <i>The Yid</i>, but its animating impulse.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Josh Lambert, <i>Moment</i></p><p>&#x201c;In <i>The Yid</i>, preparations for the pogrom are described with persuasive vividness.... Goldberg painfully evokes the anti-Semitic atmosphere in which Stalin&#x2019;s pogrom would have been conducted... The testimony of what observers saw and what they believed is a key tool in our understanding of the past. There is little in <i>The Yid</i>, at least in regard to the plans for the pogrom, that doesn&#x2019;t show up in the accounts of what Soviet Jews feared.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Ken Kalfus, <i>The New Yorker Page-Turner</i></p><p>&#x201c;On one level, <i>The Yid</i>, Goldberg's first novel, is a tribute to the millions who were exiled and murdered during Stalin&#x2019;s ruthless three-decade reign... On another, it&#x2019;s a celebration of Jewish humor, theater and language&#x2015;Yiddish is sprinkled throughout the book, and, in choosing the title, Goldberg reclaims the word &#x201c;yid&#x201d; from those who&#x2019;ve used it as a slur. These are weighty themes, but <i>The Yid</i> wears them with style, because it also happens to be a satisfying thriller.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Kevin Canfield, <i>The Star Tribune</i></p><p>&#x201c;Provocative... Imagine a Solzhenitsyn tale set in the lethal Soviet world, but restyled by Larry David.... Remarkable.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Jim Higgins, <i>Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel</i></p><p>&#x201c;If a plot by two aging Bolshevik fighters to save Soviet Jews by killing Stalin sounds crazy, just wait until you read this book! <i>The Yid</i> is Paul Goldberg&#x2019;s sophisticated, multiform, madcap romp through the alternative Soviet universe of fantasy as reality set in February 1953... <i>The Yid</i> is a rollicking delight.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Neal Gendler, <i>The American Jewish World</i></p><p>&#x201c;[THE YID is] as much history and philosophy as it is fiction. I&#x2019;ve never read anything like it. Believe me, neither have you.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Lily Meyer, <i>Electric Literature</i></p><p>&#x201c;With <i>The Yid</i>, Goldberg has found a graceful balance of gallows humor and film noir cloak-and-dagger suspense, blending hard-boiled action with Shakespearean allusions.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Jeff Milo, <i>Paste</i> Magazine &#x201c;10 of the Best New Books in February 2016&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Paul Goldberg gives Soviet terror a wild spin in <i>The Yid</i>. When Stalin&#x2019;s henchmen come for an aging Jewish actor, all hell breaks hilariously loose.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<i>More</i></p><p>&#x201c;Paul Goldberg&#x2019;s electric debut novel brings to mind, all at once: Isaac Babel, Malamud, Dostoyevsky&#x2019;s Demons, and Nathan Englander&#x2015;but his voice is wholly his own. Goldberg turns Stalin&#x2019;s Russia into the stuff of myth, while making it somehow knowable. It is iconoclastic, gleefully profane, anachronistic and coolly modern, bawdy and bloody, antic and razor-smart. Which is to say: THE YID is a rollicking reading experience unlike any other.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Daniel Torday, author of <i>The Last Flight of Poxl West</i></p><p>&#x201c;This is a sly, inventive novel that ripples with a kind of inventiveness in historical fiction that I&#x2019;ve rarely seen. &#x2018;Historians trawl with broken nets,&#x2019; says the author. But this is a densely woven net &#x2015; a text that captures a dark phase of human history with bravura. Real and unreal figures gather as the plot unfolds against the backdrop of Soviet malevolence. Paul Goldberg takes us through a narrative hall of mirrors, makes us wince and laugh, and he never loses his momentum. A brilliant debut novel.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Jay Parini, author of <i>The Last Station</i></p><p>&#x201c;Paul Goldberg&#x2019;s THE YID is an antic joyride through a grim period in Russian history. With glints of Kafka and The Big Lebowski, Goldberg&#x2019;s artful satire about antisemitism is wholly his own, and proves yet again why Jews own gallows humor.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Lisa Zeidner, author of <i>Layover</i> and <i>Love Bomb</i><br><i></i> <br>&#x201c;THE YID is one of the best debut novels in years.

Dewey&#x2019;s insights into the problems of public education, immigration, the prospects for democratic government, and the relation of religious faith to science are as fresh today as when they were first published. His penetrating treatments of the nature and function of philosophy, the ethical and aesthetic dimensions of life, and the role of inquiry in human experience are of increasing relevance at the turn of the 21st century.</p><p>Based on the award-winning 37-volume critical edition of Dewey&#x2019;s work, The Essential Dewey presents for the first time a collection of Dewey&#x2019;s writings that is both manageable and comprehensive. The volume includes essays and book chapters that exhibit Dewey&#x2019;s intellectual development over time; the selection represents his mature thinking on every major issue to which he turned his attention. Eleven part divisions cover: Dewey in Context; Reconstructing Philosophy; Evolutionary Naturalism; Pragmatic Metaphysics; Habit, Conduct, and Language; Meaning, Truth, and Inquiry; Valuation and Ethics; The Aims of Education; The Individual, the Community, and Democracy; Pragmatism and Culture: Science and Technology, Art and Religion; and Interpretations and Critiques. Taken as a whole, this collection provides unique access to Dewey&#x2019;s understanding of the problems and prospects of human existence and of the philosophical enterprise.</p></p><p>A Choice Outstanding Academic Book of 1999Dewey (1859-1952) is probably best known to the public in general for his philosophy of education. This collection of his writings, covering the entire course of his intellectual development over time, will therefore provide a necessary corrective to this limited view by showing the depth and breadth of his philosophic interests. In the course of his long life, Dewey wrote and published on myriad topics: certainly, and perhaps most importantly to him, on public education, but also?and extensively?on technical philosophy, including metaphysics, epistemology, logic, aesthetics, religion, science, ethics, and social philosophy. And though neglected by academic philosophers for a time, Dewey's pragmatic orientation has recently proved influential in the thought of Quine, Putnam, and Rorty, among others. This two-volume collection of essays and book chapters, culled from an earlier 37-volume critical edition of his works, provides for the first time a publication of his writings that is both manageable and comprehensive.

Jakkin and Akki, whom readers met in the two preceeding volumes, have survived in the Austarian wilds through bonding with the dragon Heart's Blood, and in this volume continue their harrowing journey to freedom and spiritual enlightenment. Like the two volumes preceeding it, A Sending of Dragons ' particular strengths are in the almost encyclopedic detail which Yolen has lavished upon her fully realized alternative world of Austar IV, in her sympathetic portrayal of the dragons as both victims and telepathic partners, and in the symbolic sub-text which enriches her narrative and reinforces her universal theme of the inter-dependency and unique value of all life forms. Similarly the shortcomings reflect those of the two companion volumes: these include certain stylistic shortcomings and a tendency toward one-dimensional characterization. Nevertheless the trilogy remains an ambitious and rewarding work of speculative fiction. The two previous volumes should be read for a more complete understanding and appreciation of this concluding volume.

When The Museum of Modern Art was founded in 1929, its first director, Alfred H. Barr, Jr., dedicated it to helping people understand and enjoy the new visual arts of the time, his hope was that this new institution would offer New York &#34;perhaps the greatest museum of modern art in the world.&#34; The public responded with enthusiasm--and has continued to do so over the history of the Museum&#39;s extraordinary development: from an initial gift of eight prints and one drawing, MoMA&#39;s collection has grown to include over 100,000 paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints, photographs, architectural models and drawings, and design objects; 19,000 films and four million film stills; and 160,000 books, artists&#39; books, and periodicals. Published on the occasion of the Museum&#39;s 75th birthday and the opening of its new building, Art in Our Time: A History of MoMA, is a picture book of historical photographs and archival documents, many of which have never before been published. Included are images of the various Museum buildings and gardens, from its original home in the Heckscher Building at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street, to its present location in Yoshio Taniguchi&#39;s complex on 53rd Street; installation shots of major exhibitions and important events at the Museum, and photographs of curatorial staff and Museum officials whose discerning policies helped shape our understanding of modern art. Documents include excerpts from letters, invitations, and other archival material that tell the story of The Museum of Modern Art from its beginnings to the present. The book is divided into eight sections starting with documentation of the modern art scene in New York prior to the Museum&#39;s opening; and then offering a chronology that covers the museum&#39;s 75-year history in seven parts divided into 10- to 15-year increments.</p><p></p><h2>The Little Book of Witchcraft: Explore the ancient practice of natural magic and daily ritual</h2><p><br>Witchcraft has existed since the days of Greek mythology and is now practiced as widely as modern pagan religions.

This journal is designed as a companion to help you reflect on what you learn as you read through <em>A Long Obedience.</em> Inside you will find: <ul><li><strong>Beginning to Obey</strong><br>Examine your life in the light of our culture and consider how God may be calling you.</li><li><strong>Pondering the Word</strong><br>Look closely at one or more passages of Scripture.</li><li><strong>Recording Your Journey</strong><br>Consider how God has guided and protected you thus far.</li><li><strong>Writing to God</strong><br>Respond to God directly through meditation, thanksgiving, supplication and listening prayer.</li><li><strong>Worshiping God</strong><br>Revel in God's generosity and faithfulness.</li></ul> In a culture that focuses on shallow efforts and instantaneous results, this journal will help you to go deep so that you can focus on God for the long journey.

He wrote more than thirty books, including his widely acclaimed paraphrase of the Bible <em>The Message: The Bible in Contemporary Language</em> and bestselling spiritual formation classic <em>A Long Obedience in the Same Direction</em>. Peterson was founding pastor of Christ Our King Presbyterian Church in Bel Air, Maryland, where he served for twenty-nine years before retiring in 1991. With degrees from Seattle Pacific, New York Theological Seminary, and Johns Hopkins University, he served as professor of spiritual theology at Regent College in Vancouver, British Columbia, until retiring in 2006."There is a clean, bright rigor to honest life before God. Burnishing the language of the Psalms, Eugene Peterson makes that life sing like a taut wire. A Long Obedience is the only path of discipleship to Jesus, and this is a message we desperately need to hear and implement today." -- <i>Dallas Willard, author of The Divine Conspiracy</i></p><h2>Over The Rainbow : Tales of Fantasy and Imagination</h2><p>Stories are: The Truth about Pyecraft by H.

Here are synopses of all of Shakespeare's plays by act and scene; sketches of all of his characters, as well as the historic personages on whom some of them were based; biographies of his contemporaries in the Elizabethan theater; portraits of many of the actors who achieved fame in his plays; and mentions of many modern theatrical works that have been influenced by him. One can also find definitions of literary and theatrical terms relevant to his work, along with descriptions of the places that figured so prominently in Shakespeare's plays. The book is truly a treasure trove of information for students of Shakespeare, of English literature, and of Elizabethan and modern theater.<br><i>-Richard Lisker, Fairfax County Public Library, VA</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.This work invites comparison with the Reader's Encyclopedia of Shakespeare (1966). Both provide remarkable levels of detail on virtually any aspect of Shakespeare's life and art. The Reader's Encyclopedia, however, is now nearly a quarter of a century old; it does not, for example, include entries for Branagh's 1989 film of Henry V or Joseph Papp, the noted producer, both included here. But it is much broader in scope, including bibliographies as well as articles on such figures as Stendahl (author of a book on Shakespeare). More comprehensive, it may still be the best book on the subject, but it is now out of print. Boyce's work is well done and much more current, and it includes many unique entries. It will be a useful complement for libraries owning the Reader's Encyclopedia and a fine addition for those that don't. -- Peter Dollard, Alma Coll.

Dershowitz, &#34;abuse excuses&#34; are enabling people to get away with murder - literally. From the Menendez brothers to Lorena Bobbitt, more and more Americans accused of violent crimes are admitting to the charges, but arguing that they shouldn&#39;t be held legally responsible. The reason: they&#39;re victims - of an abusive parent, a violent spouse, a traumatic experience, ethnic hatred, society at large, or anything else - who struck back at a real or perceived oppressor. And they couldn&#39;t help themselves, they say. In this provocative and important collection of essays, Dershowitz reviews a wide range of recent cases - including those of O. J. Simpson, Tonya Harding, and Woody Allen - and argues that the current vogue in victim defenses is antithetical to the ideals of our constitutional democracy. For Dershowitz, the foundations of American society are individual responsibility and the rule of law. And people who claim to be above the law - whatever the excuse - are no more than vigilantes.Alan M.

And of her Friends, male and female, and her acquaintances as well. But Merritt&#39;s favourite motif is herself: she poses almost every minute of the day for her camera, taking photographs of herself in bed, in the shower, having sex with her friend, masturbating with and without accessories, from every imaginable angle and with the camera usually at arm&#39;s length. Merritt, born 1977, works with a digital camera, the Polaroid of the 90s, breaking down the most intimate details into universally accessible bits of information. Eric Kroll came across Natacha Merritt by chance in the internet, where she had put several of her photographs. This was something that left the tradition of classical pin-up and fetish photography, in which Kroll himself works, far behind. Face to face with Merritt&#39;s photographs one can reflect on intimacy and publicity in the digital age, on narcissism even, or on radical self-exploration with the help of the camera. But this all sounds better as Natacha Merritt herself puts it: in her view, she has found a new mode of masturbating her way into the next millennium.</p><p>"My photo needs and my sexual needs are one and the same."

She went to Paris to study law but after three months abandoned her studies for a much more exciting part-time job: taking digital photographs of models with her Casio, at a time when digital cameras were rare and expensive in Europe. Merritt quickly discovered the advantages of this technologe. On her return to San Francisco she showed her works on the Internet. In March 1999 she received a call from Eric Kroll, and shortly afterwards met up with Benedikt Taschen in L.A. - the start of &#34;Digital Diaries&#34;.

Hardcover with dustjacket, 1st British edition. One of the bestselling memoirs of all time, David Niven&#39;s The Moon&#39;s a Balloon is an account of one of the most remarkable lives Hollywood has ever seen. Beginning with the tragic early loss of his aristocratic father, then regaling us with tales of school, army and wartime hi-jinx, Niven shows how, even as an unknown young man, he knew how to live the good life. But it is his astonishing stories of life in Hollywood and his accounts of working and partying with the legends of the silver screen - Lawrence Oliver, Vivien Leigh, Cary Grant, Elizabeth Taylor, James Stewart, Lauren Bacall, Marlene Dietrich, Noel Coward and dozens of others, while making some of the most acclaimed films of the last</p><p>David Niven was born in London in 1910.

From polar ice to coral reef and on every continent, major habitats are described with accompanying illustrations of dozens of animals, both common and rare: birds, mammals, insects, reptiles, amphibians. For North America, for example, there are double spreads depicting the forest, lakes and prairies, the Rockies, western deserts, and the Everglades. Lilly's appealing color illustrations show animals in many activities: eating, swimming, running, resting. Regional topological maps with line drawings of the animals indicate range. Common and scientific names, sizes, and a brief paragraph about each animal add interesting or unusual facts. Careful layout and use of white space give unity to each spread while providing opportunities to examine the animals individually. An introduction shows how to use the atlas; there's a section on endangered animals. An excellent purchase, worth every penny. Index. (Nonfiction. 7-12) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Grade 4 Up-- This spectacular guide to animal life throughout the world offers interesting, often unusual, information together with stunning illustrations in an appealing format. Divided by continent and habitat, the book presents animals of all types, many rarely discussed elsewhere, and shows their characteristics, homes, and habits. Although environmental problems are often mentioned and there is a section called ``Animals in Danger,'' ecology is not the main focus here. Rather, it is a beautiful presentation of the wonderous jewels that inhabit our Earth. Introducing children to the wealth of animal life around them presents an excellent case for environmental awareness. Don't relegate this to the reference shelf, as it makes fascinating recreational reading for nature lovers. --Eva Elisabeth Von Ancken, Trinity Pawling School, NY<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Homegrown and Handmade: A Practical Guide to More Self-Reliant Living</h2><p><p>Our food system is dominated by industrial agriculture and has become economically and environmentally unsustainable. The incidence of diet-related diseases, including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, and heart disease, has skyrocketed to unprecedented levels.

Whether they are asking about our homesteading lifestyle or my diet, the answer is a resounding, "No!" I grew up in Refugio, Texas, a small town on the Gulf Coast, and I couldn't wait to move to the big city. I spent many weekends in Houston, and after graduating from high school, I attended college at Eastern Connecticut State University. Armani was more familiar to me than arugula. I ate out more than I ate at home, and when I did eat at home, the food often came from a box or can. I was close to my teen years before I ate a raw vegetable, and that was iceberg lettuce drowned in salad dressing.<br> <br> When I became pregnant with my first child, I honestly believed that a cheeseburger and fries was a good, healthy meal. I had my meat, dairy, bread, and vegetables. Yes, I thought that a piece of lettuce, a couple of pickle slices, and french fries counted as vegetables. I was proud of myself for eliminating caffeine from my two-liter daily soda consumption. After my baby was born, I started reading about nutrition and thought that maybe my poor diet had contributed to my constant illness as a child. Hoping to save my own children from the same sad fate, I started eliminating artificial ingredients from our diet and began baking bread. Over the years, we became more conscientious about our dietary choices, and by 2002, it seemed like moving to the country to grow our own food was the next logical step.<br> <br> I always say that if we can do this, anyone can, and I'm not joking. Our livestock experience consisted of caring for two cats and a poodle before we moved out here. You don't have to be a master gardener to grow your own food. Our first garden produced only a handful of stringy green beans, but from reading books, finding mentors, trying, and making mistakes, we've learned to do everything we do today.<p><strong>A modern approach to homesteading &#x2013; no farm required</strong></p> <p><em>...buy this book, read it and then go do something.

In fact, Dora bore no less than ten children and the couple lived happily in a villa on the Thames until William bowed to pressure and abandoned her. Making full use of Dora&#39;s letters to William, Claire Tomalin vividly re-creates the royal, political and theatrical worlds of late eighteenth-century England. The story of how Dora moved between stage and home, of how she battled for her family and her career makes a classic tale of royal perfidy and womanly courage. &#39;Intelligent, finely made and wonderfully readable. As gripping as the best fiction&#39; - Jan Dalley, &#34;Independent on Sunday&#34;.</p><p>Claire Tomalin was born in London in 1933.

Her terse diary entries create a vivid picture of the journey's challenges (terrible weather, dangerous rivers, bad roads, privation, sickness, accidents) and of a strong pioneer spirit; at the end, the birth of Knight's eighth child near Oregon's Columbia River is the first mention of her pregnancy. In McCurdy's tinted scratchboard illustrations, the pioneers are seen from a low point of view, so that even children and livestock seem larger than life, looming with rugged nobility and solid purpose in a landscape of strong, simple lines--in sharp contrast to Thomas Allen's softened, more intimate scenes for Van Leeuwen's Going West or Mark Graham's romanticized paintings in Pryor's Lottie's Dream (both 1992). First Americans don't come off quite as well here; they beg for food or sell it, collect tolls at fords, and are generally friendly but unpredictable. Schlissel provides a brief introduction concerning the pioneer experience, but unfortunately doesn't discuss the extent of her adaptation. An effective tribute, as far as it goes, to a great enterprise; visually appealing, with historical interest but in need of the kind of careful explanation provided for Marion Russell's memoirs (p. 1079). (Nonfiction/Picture book. 7-10) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Gr. 2-5. McCurdy's attractive artwork, strong woodcuts tinted with watercolor washes, decorates nearly every page of this book, which shows a pioneer family's journey from Iowa to Oregon in 1853. The story is told in "adapted" excerpts from the journal of Amelia Stewart Knight, a wife and mother who looked after her brood of seven children, gave birth to her eighth on the trail, and still found time to write. Although the telling is matter-of-fact, the various discomforts and dangers of the trip become apparent as the tale unfolds: kids get the mumps, everyone gets cold and wet and muddy, oxen go lame, rivers must be crossed with or without bridges, daughter Lucy gets left behind at one point (she's later returned to her family), and son Chat falls out of the wagon and is nearly run over by a wheel. The colorful, rhythmic illustrations dramatize events along the trail. The introduction fills in some details of wagon-train travel, but it omits background information on the diary itself, such as where it was found and how freely it was adapted. Still, teachers seeking materials on the Oregon Trail will find this a lively, useful resource. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i></p><h2>Murder for Christmas: 26 Tales of Seasonal Malice</h2><p>Presenting twenty six tales of seasonal malice, this mystery anthology features the works of Agatha Christie, Woody Allen, Ellery Queen, Rex Stout, Dorothy L.

This new book unites the first volume with a sequel penned by noted scientist Benford ( Timescape ), whose work has often been compared to Clarke's. Benford's story takes place many years later: Earth is now under siege by the "Mad Mind," a being of pure mentality created by a much earlier galactic Empire. Cley, last of the seemingly primitive "Ur-humans," initially refuses to help Alvin, Clarke's hero, in battle. But she begins to view her role differently with the aid of Seeker, a furry "raccoon-creature" whose species avows "a respect for evolution and one's place in it." Although Benford's unflagging inventiveness will both delight and outrage fans of the original work, ultimately the sequel proves a let-down. Benford seems hindered by having to emulate Clarke's simpler and less contemporary style, and ends up using a number of tangential events to explore his own scientific concerns.

Central to the book are Carle's autobiography, a reprint of his 1990 Library of Congress speech, and his art-a photo essay, book illustrations, and an international bibliography. Other voices add shading. A brief introduction, for example, in which Carle's American editor recounts their working relationship, provides critical context. His German editor examines the dramatic elements in Carle's stories. And a Japanese art curator speaks of colors "far beyond any human sense of color." Like Carle's books for children, the inviting page design encourages careful consideration of what he calls his "dabs of color"-the personal and professional influences upon artistic style. The book will engage adolescents and adults already familiar with Carle's work, but it is especially suited to professionals interested in the origins of creativity.<br><i>Sue Burgess, Framingham (MA) State College</i><br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Fatal Frenzy (The Fatal Series)</h2><p><em>Inauguration day is almost here...&nbsp;</em><br><br>Lieutenant Sam Holland is on leave, recovering from an attack that shook her to the core.

Surrounded by familiar buff-colored cinder block walls, Sam felt claustrophobic and panicky. Even the burnt-coffee smell of the place nauseated her. She needed to get out of there. Now. "Sam."<br><br>She glanced at Dr. Trulo, who gazed intently at her, his gray eyes never wavering. His hair had gotten thinner since the last time she was forced to spend time with him, after young Quentin Johnson died at the hands of her officers in his father's crack house.<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"I can't clear you to go back to work until you talk about it."<br><br>"What's there to talk about? I did a stupid thing, and I paid the price. Should I have gone in there alone? No. I know that. I knew it then, but I had no reason to suspect that Marissa Springer was going to turn into a murdering lunatic or that she'd partnered up with Stahl. As far as I knew she was a grieving mother, a disgruntled wife and a source of information." Sam shrugged. "There. I talked about it. Can I go now?"<br><br>He continued to stare at her without blinking. How did he do that? Everyone needed to blink once in a while, didn't they? Perhaps one of the job requirements for being a police department shrink was a freakish staring ability.<br><br>She shifted in her seat, crossed her legs and then her arms. "What else do you want me to say?"<br><br>"I want to hear about what happened with Stahl. How you coped during the assault. What you're thinking about now. How you're sleeping. You could start by telling me what it was like to be wrapped in razor wire by a man you once reported to."<br><br>"It was sharp."<br><br>Trulo finally blinked&#x2014;and sighed deeply. "Maybe we should reschedule for next week."<br><br>"Next week is kind of busy. The inauguration and all that."<br><br>"Are you aware that your squad is frantically trying to find the person responsible for a series of knife attacks?"<br><br>For the first time she felt a twinge of guilt at letting down her closest colleagues. "I'm aware of that." The city was on edge after a series of brazen and seemingly random attacks that had left two people dead and two others gravely injured. Sam was sorry she wasn't able to help this time, but she couldn't single-handedly catch every killer who roamed the city's streets.<br><br>"Do you <em>want</em> to come back to work, Sam?"<br><br>"Yes! Of course I do. What kind of question is that?" Her heart began to race at how close he'd come to uncovering her recent anxiety about work and safety and the loss of her famous mojo. It would come back. Eventually. It had to come back. Didn't it? Who was she without it?<br><br>"It's an honest question. You've been in this game long enough to know that if you don't <em>play</em> the game, you remain on the sidelines. I can't clear you to come back until I'm certain you've dealt with the trauma of what happened and are in the right place mentally, physically and emotionally to resume your duties."<br><br>Sam was never more mulish than when pushed into a corner, and now was no different. "How am I supposed to prove to you that I'm fine?"<br><br>"You have to talk about it."<br><br>"What if I don't want to talk about it? What if talking about it makes it worse?"<br><br>"Have you talked to anyone? Your husband? Your friends, colleagues, your dad, sisters? Anyone?"<br><br>"Yeah, I've talked to them," she said, squirming again. She hated the feeling that he saw right through her bullshit the way Nick did too. He'd been watching her like a hawk recently&#x2014;to the point that she'd been actively avoiding her overly devoted husband for the first time ever.<br><br>Sam knew she wouldn't get away with that for much longer, and Trulo wasn't about to buckle either. "I'd like to leave now."<br><br>"No one is forcing you to be here."<br><br>She gave him her best "yeah right" look. Did he actually think any cop saw him voluntarily? "Hello, Command Referral. Like I have a choice."<br><br>"You know what I mean. This process is on your schedule. When you're ready, make an appointment. I'm here for you whenever you need me."<br><br>With the lure of freedom in her reach, Sam began to stand.<br><br>"Before you go, though..."<br><br>Foiled, she sagged back into the uncomfortable hardback chair.<br><br>"I want to say one thing." Trulo cleared his throat and seemed to force himself to look at her. What was that about? "I read the report on what happened that day at the Springers' house, and I just want to say... I've been doing this for a long time, and what happened to you, well, it was bad, Sam. Really bad. And there's no shame in admitting that you're traumatized by it, that maybe you've lost your taste for the job, that&#x2014;"<br><br>"No." Sam leapt to her feet. "Whatever you're going to say, just save it. I'm fine. I haven't lost my taste for anything except this meeting. Some people don't feel the need to air out all their shit in some touchy-feely room where it's supposedly <em>safe</em> to spill their guts. We aren't safe anywhere. That's the lesson learned here."<br><br>"Now we're getting somewhere," he said with a small, satisfied grin that infuriated her. "Call me when you're ready to talk about why you don't feel safe anywhere."<br><br>Pissed with herself and with him, Sam stormed out of the office, slamming the door behind her. She was on her way to a clean escape when Captain Malone waylaid her, taking her by the arm and escorting her into his office where she shook him off. "You need a refresher in sensitivity training if you think you can manhandle your female officers that way."<br><br>"So report me."<br><br>"What do you want?"<br><br>"Nice to see you too, Lieutenant. We've missed your charming self around here."<br><br>Sam rolled her eyes. Charming. Whatever. "Is there something you need?"<br><br>"Have a seat."<br><br>"I prefer to stand."<br><br>"I wasn't asking."<br><br>Since he so rarely pulled rank on her, she dropped into the chair he pointed to and crossed her arms again, keeping with the mulish theme of the day.<br><br>"How've you been?"<br><br>"Great. You?"<br><br>"I'm down one of my best officers, so things have been a little hectic, especially since someone is going around killing people with a hunting knife. But we're coping."<br><br>She refused to feel guilty about sitting this one out. Her team was highly trained, and they'd figure it out. They always did. "Glad to hear it."<br><br>"How's it going with Trulo?"<br><br>"You're not allowed to ask me that."<br><br>"Add it to the report you're going to submit on my bad behavior."<br><br>"I have been attending the appointments as required. Would you like me to tell you what we talk about in there? It would only take a minute. Probably less than a minute."<br><br>Malone sat back in his chair, exhaling loudly. "So you're not cooperating."<br><br>"I didn't say that."<br><br>"Don't you want to get back to work?"<br><br>Sam shrugged. "I'm kinda enjoying the time off. I like taking my kid to school&#x2014;even if the Secret Service has to butt into our time together&#x2014;and taking my dad to his appointments and hanging out with my husband and cleaning my house."<br><br>Malone sat up straight, his eyes wide with alarm. "You're <em>cleaning</em> your house? What the hell is wrong with you, Holland? You'd rather be cleaning your house than chasing down murderers? Things are worse than we thought."<br><br>"We? We who?"<br><br>"All of us! We're wondering what the hell is going on with you and why you don't seem to have any desire to come back to work. Every other time something crazy has happened, we've had to practically lock you to your sofa. But not this time. This time something's different."<br><br>Sam made a conscious effort not to squirm as he stared her down, looking for answers she simply didn't have. She didn't know why she had no desire to go back to work. She didn't know why she felt dead inside or why she wondered if she would ever again be able to trust her own judgment when it had failed her so dramatically. She didn't have the answers they all wanted so badly, and until she did, they weren't going to let her come back. So she'd decided to enjoy the unexpected time off. What else could she do?<br><br>"Sam, this is <em>me"</em> He'd been her mentor and friend since the day she made detective. "Talk to me, will you? Tell me what you're thinking."<br><br>His concern touched off another wave of guilt at knowing she had caused him&#x2014;and others&#x2014;such dismay.<br><br>When she remained silent, he said, "I want you to know... We, all of us, from the chief on down, we failed you in this situation with Stahl. It never occurred to us that he would take it as far as he did, and that's on us."<br><br>Sam rose to her feet. "I gotta go, Cap. It was good to see you."<br><br>"Sam, wait."<br><br>Before he could make it around his desk, she was out the door and headed for the morgue and the closest exit. She burst into the frigid January day and took deep breaths of the cold air. Her eyes darted around the parking lot, on the lookout for enemies. After fourteen years on the job, she'd made more than her share of them. Now she knew they weren't afraid to come after her, to try to take everything from her. She'd learned to be wary and more afraid than she'd ever been before.<br><br>When Nick accepted the president's offer to become his new vice president, he'd declined Secret Service protection for her so she could continue to do the job she loved. That she was actually thinking about requesting a detail was indicative of how screwed up everything had gotten since Stahl attacked her.<br><br>She got into her car and drove home, the one place she felt safe these days, surrounded as they were by Nick's detail and Scotty's. The house was like a fortress, and she liked it that way. No one could get to her there.<br><br>Sam pulled onto Ninth Street and was waved through the checkpoint by a Secret Service officer. She parked in front of the house and was surprised to see Nick's black BMW parked at the curb. What was that doing here? He'd told her he'd sold it since he could no longer drive himself.<br><br>Grabbing her purse, she got out of the car and went up the ramp to the home she shared with Nick and Scotty. An agent greeted her at the door and opened it for her. "Thank you," she said.<br><br>"My pleasure, Mrs. Cappuano."<br><br>Not that long ago, Sam would've told the agent to call her Lieutenant Holland, but lately she'd grown used to hearing her married name from the agents that surrounded her family. It didn't rankle the way it once would have. In the ten months they'd been married, some of Lieutenant Holland had given way to make room for Mrs. Cappuano.<br><br>Speaking of the devil who'd made her his missus, Nick came out of the kitchen wearing a gorgeous dark gray suit with a cranberry-colored tie that was one of her favorites. As he had from the moment she first met him years ago, he took her breath away just by walking into the room.<br><br>"Hey, babe. How was the appointment with Trulo?"<br><br>"More of the same." She dropped her coat and purse on the sofa, earning a frown from her neat-freak husband. In a mocking tone, she said, "'Tell us how you feel, talk about what happened, blah, blah, blah.' I don't know what they want me to say. It happened, I survived, it's over and he's locked up."<br><br>Nick kissed her forehead and gazed down at her, taking in every detail with gorgeous hazel eyes that saw right through her&#x2014;and her bullshit. "You know what they want from you, Samantha, and the sooner you give it to them, the sooner you'll be back on the job."<br><br>The Secret Service had given them the room, so she ran her fingertip down the silk tie and dipped it under his belt, pleased to realize he'd delayed the start of his day to be here when she got home. "Maybe I don't want to go back to work. Maybe I'd rather be the second lady for a while and tend to my vice president anytime he needs tending to."<br><br>His Adam's apple bobbed in his throat. "Um, who are you and what've you done with my wife?"<br><br>For the first time in hours, Sam laughed.<br><br>"No, seriously. You want to be the second lady rather than a cop?" He pressed his hand to her forehead. "No fever, but maybe we should call Harry just to be safe."<br><br>"Knock it off." She batted his hand away. "Is there anything wrong with enjoying a little break from the rat race?"<br><br>"If you were anyone else, I'd say of course not. But because you're you, I see reason for concern. Perhaps even alarm. You love the rat race. You live for it. Or you did until Stahl lost his mind. Since then, you haven't been quite yourself, babe. We've all noticed it."<br><br>Sam wasn't surprised that he was tuned in to her as always and wouldn't settle for the platitudes she'd given Trulo. "I'm working through some things having to do with the attack and the job and where I go from here." It was the most she'd said to anyone since that awful day. "I just need some time. As long as I'm on leave, I may as well enjoy it, right?"<br><br>"I suppose. But the cleaning and all that... You're kind of freaking us out."<br><br>Smiling, she put her arms around him and leaned into the comfort of his embrace, breathing in the familiar scent of home. "I'll knock off the cleaning."<br><br>He held her tight against him. "Thank God."<br><br>"How come your car is outside? I thought you sold it."<br><br>"Yeah, about that, I lied."<br><br>She lifted her head off his chest to give him the wifely evil eye. "You <em>lied?</em> Start talking."<br><br>"When we declined Secret Service protection for you, I didn't exactly do that without some significant fears&#x2014;and that was before everything happened with Stahl. So I decided. Well, come with me. Let me show you." He held her coat for her while she put it back on and then took her by the hand to lead her to the door.<br><br>The agent on duty stopped them. "Are you leaving, sir?"<br><br>"Just going outside for a minute."<br><br>The agent spoke into the microphone attached to a wire that hung from his ear. "Hotshot and Fuzz are on the move."<br><br><em>"Fuzz?"</em> Sam said, looking up at Nick. "That had better not be a reference to my hair."<br><br>"Did I forget to mention we've been assigned code names? And I believe yours is more about your job than your hair."<br><br>"It had better be. <em>Fuzz?</em> Really? How come you get to be Hotshot and I'm <em>Fuzz?</em> Is there an appeal process?"<br><br>Hand over his mouth, the agent laughed silently.<br><br>"It's not funny! I have a reputation to uphold here. Fuzz is a puppy or a kitten. It's not a badass cop."<br><br>"I'll take it up with those in charge," the agent said solemnly, obviously trying not to laugh out loud.<br><br>Sam scowled at him. "You do that."<br><br>"You may proceed, Mr. Vice President, Mrs. Cap-puano."<br><br>Sam left the agent with a final glare as she let Nick lead her out the door.<br><br>"I can't tell you how much I hate having to get permission to walk out my own door," he said.<br><br>"You knew it would be like that."<br><br>"Still, it sucks balls."<br><br>"Speaking of sucking balls&#x2014;"<br><br>"Not here. Not now."<br><br>"How do you know what I was going to say?"<br><br>His side-eyed glance said it all. Removing a key fob from his pocket, he unlocked the BMW. "Hop in," he said, holding the passenger door for her.<br><br>"Um, okay. I thought you weren't allowed to drive yourself anywhere?"<br><br>"We're not leaving."<br><br>"I'm not making out with you in broad daylight wit...</p><h2>The Birthgrave</h2><p><i>The Birthgrave</i> is <b>Tanith Lee's</b> first published novel -- the first book of a trilogy of stunning imagination -- and remains one of her most memorable best.

AND TM. OFF. AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES&#x2014;MARCA REGISTRADA HECHO EN U.S.A.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>Don Wollhem wrote to tell me he had just bought a long novel by an unknown Englishwoman whose only previous books had been written for children. He asked me to read it and, if I felt it was something I could honestly praise, to write an introduction.</p><p>It arrived on a morning full of annoyances. I was still recuperating after a slipped disk, so that I walked with a sort of careful crouch and winced when I hefted the thick manuscript. Still, I&#x2019;d promised Wollheim and he <i>is </i>my own publisher, so I surveyed the fat mass of copy paper without enthusiasm, cautiously lowered my aching back into a kitchen chair, and spread out the manuscript on the table.</p><p>So I turned the first page and found myself in the heart of an extinct volcano, in darkness, with a woman who did not know who she was, or where she was, or why.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>And before long I forgot that I was reading this out of duty, or a promise to an editor, or anything else. I even forgot the kitchen chair and the bad back, although after a couple of hours (sleepwalking, still reading with the manuscript box under my arm, unable to set it aside even to hunt a really comfortable place) I <i>did </i>shift myself from kitchen table to living-room sofa. I had forgotten everything except the nameless woman and her mysterious quest.</p><p>I am a remarkably fast reader, but it was almost five hours later when I turned over the last page, read THE END, and surfaced with a start and a shudder. <i>Wow, </i>I thought. <i>Oh, wow!</i></p><p>All I thought about the task of writing an introduction was that I&#x2019;d have a chance to share with the other readers something of how I felt about this terrific new discovery.</p><p>It&#x2019;s a strange and rather disturbing book. It&#x2019;s filled with adventure and beauty, rich alien names, half-sketched barbarian societies, ruined cities, decadence and wonder. A nameless woman, knowing only that she is under a curse, comes out of the heart of an extinct volcano. Everything is strange to her. Is she healer-woman, witch, goddess, as the various peoples call her? Can she choose to be courtesan, warrior, queen? She goes from tribe to tribe, city to city, with the curse of her past following her wherever she goes. She can suffer pain&#x2014;but she is deathless, except by her own will; she is drawn endlessly by the quest for her identity, her forgotten name, the mysterious Jade which&#x2014;she believes&#x2014;holds the key to her soul; and everywhere she is pursued by the image of the Knife of Easy Dying, which alone can kill her.</p><p>Comparisons are odious, yet as I read this I thought most often of the &#x201c;Dying Earth&#x201d; stories of Jack Vance, under whose spell I had fallen as a girl. THE BIRTHGRAVE has something of the same color and wonder; something, too, of the strange undertone of doom and sadness.</p><p>And there was something else.</p><p>Most women in science fiction write from a man&#x2019;s viewpoint. In most human societies, adventures have been structured for men. Women who wish to write of adventure have had to accept, willy-nilly, this limitation. There seems an unspoken assumption in science fiction that science fiction is usually read by men, or, if it is read by women, it is read by those women who are bored with feminine concerns and wish to escape into the world of fantasy where they can change their internal viewpoint and gender and share the adventurous world of men. Maybe this was true at one time. The women&#x2019;s liberationists would say that we women writers, too, had been brainwashed into accepting this pervasive social trend.</p><p>By and large, most of us have accepted the unspoken dictum that this is a man&#x2019;s world, and if we wish to compete in it, we shall do so as men. All of us, and I include myself, have written mostly of men&#x2019;s doings and concerns, and all too often from a man&#x2019;s point of view.</p><p>So maybe this is the book we&#x2019;ve all been waiting for.</p><p>Here is a woman writer whose protagonist is a woman&#x2014;yet from the very first she takes her destiny in her own hands, neither slave nor chattel. Her adventures are her own. She is not dragged into them by the men in her life, nor served up to the victor as a sexual reward after the battle. For the first time since C. L. Moore&#x2019;s warrior-woman, Jirel of Joiry, we see the woman-adventurer in her own right.</p><p>But this book is not an enormous allegory of women&#x2019;s liberation, nor an elaborate piece of special pleading. It&#x2019;s just a big delightful <i>feast </i>of excitement and adventure.</p><p>It&#x2019;s a <i>long </i>book. You get involved, learn to know the people, get fully submerged in the colorful and fascinating world Tanith Lee presents. And I predict that when you, at last, satisfied but regretful, turn over the last page, you too will wish there were more.</p><p>As I found out when I read it through under what must be called acid-test conditions, it&#x2019;s what Don Wollheim calls &#x201c;a good read.&#x201d; But it&#x2019;s more than that. It has something to say to every reader, man or woman, about the eternal questions of existence and identity. And, although as I said before, it is <i>not </i>a piece of propaganda from women&#x2019;s liberation, it may say more for all of us, women and men too, than the whole humorless crowd of Steinems, de Beauvoirs, Friedans, and all their weighty tomes.</p><p>Now get on with it. I won&#x2019;t keep you any longer from the excitement of sharing with me this rich new discovery&#x2014;THE BIRTHGRAVE by Tanith Lee.</p><p></p><p></p><p>AUTHOR&#x2019;S NOTE</p><p>This novel was written by me around the age of 22. I read it aloud to my mother, a great listener, as I went. Later she typed the manuscript&#x2014;the only human being able to read my &#x201c;writing-a-story&#x201d; handwriting. Then or now.</p><p>But when we sent it to publishers, nobody was interested. Many didn&#x2019;t even reply.</p><p>It didn&#x2019;t stop me writing (evidently), but it stopped me hoping.</p><p>However&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>* * *</p><p>The arrival for the idea of <i>The Birthgrave </i>was quite strange. The image of the ice-white being, trapped in the red-hot volcano. The dreams I had&#x2014;as later told <i>in </i>the book&#x2014;waking and not knowing <i>what </i>I was, let alone who. The dreams of flying&#x2014;feeling the wing-tendons waking up in the muscles of my back&#x2014;</p><p>But the other extraordinary thing which occurred is <i>not </i>mystical. It is a curious and perfect coincidence I&#x2019;ve always treasured.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Earlier, I&#x2019;d spent a year at art college. This really got me back on the rails as a person, and developed my drawing skills, such as they are.</p><p>Then the year ended. So I took various jobs: waitressing, shop work, etc.</p><p>One evening, I was meeting a friend from the college. We were meant to coincide about 5:30, and it was late April or May. As I stood waiting at the bus stop for her bus to arrive, the sky undid itself and about ten tons of <i>snow </i>descended. (Hey, it&#x2019;s England!)</p><p>Asking a harried bus inspector, I was told my friend <i>would</i>, probably, arrive, but would be an hour to an hour and a half late.</p><p>By then I was up to my ankles (I don&#x2019;t lie) in freezing snow.</p><p>I hauled myself out and staggered into W. H. Smith, the large, warm bookstore that lay just back from the bus stop.</p><p>The thing with Smith&#x2019;s was they had an excellent fantasy/SF section then. And an especially good selection of those smart, unique volumes produced by DAW Books of America. (I still love those early yellow covers, each one with its single bright &#x201c;window.&#x201d;)</p><p>I was so often finding a fascinating read among them. Warmed up, and grabbing a novel for the check-out, I felt better. When the world doesn&#x2019;t work, one of the best places to go is a book. Read it. Write it.</p><p>And this was the moment, and not remotely mystical, but&#x2014;</p><p>No, I didn&#x2019;t hear voices, but it was as if something said to me: &#x201c;This company doesn&#x2019;t do what anyone else does. Why don&#x2019;t you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. try approaching them?&#x201d;</p><p>And I thought: Don&#x2019;t be daft. Nobody wants my stuff. And look who DAW publishes&#x2014;Marion Zimmer Bradley! <i>Famous</i> writers.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, go on,&#x201d; said my silly, wise back-brain. &#x201c;You admire them. <i>Trust </i>them.&#x201d;</p><p>So I bought my book and met my friend. A few days later I tried the Approach to DAW. Expecting the normal rebuff.</p><p>To my amazement, I got a very nice reply. Sounds interesting, was the gist. Let&#x2019;s see a synopsis and some text.</p><p>Luckily, since I seldom know how a story of mine is going to end till it&#x2019;s got there, I&#x2019;d written <i>The Birthgrave</i>, and so could do a direct synopsis from the established plot.</p><p>Again, quite speedily, I had a reply: &#x201c;Send all.&#x201d; I couldn&#x2019;t believe it. Then believed it. Sent all, and subsequently the two other novels I&#x2019;d written, <i>The Storm Lord </i>and <i>Don&#x2019;t Bite the Sun</i>.</p><p>DAW took everything.</p><p>And from the outer dark beyond the hearth-fire I was liberated into the joy and light of a career as what I truly was, doing the only thing I could do well, and <i>loved </i>to do.

He <i>gave </i>me what I was, fully, and let me run with the torch.</p><p>I&#x2019;m still running with it.</p><p>My everlasting thanks to him and to his daughter, my friend Elizabeth (Betsy) Wollheim, goes beyond words.</p><p>And for a writer to find they have no words&#x2014;oh joy!</p><p>Tanith Lee</p><p>January, 2015</p><p></p><p></p><p>Book One</p><p></p><p></p><p>Part I: Under the Volcano</p><p>1</p><p>TO WAKE, AND not to know where, or who you are, not even to know what you are&#x2014;whether a thing with legs and arms, or a beast, or a brain in the hull of a great fish&#x2014;that is a strange awakening. But after a while, uncurling in the darkness, I began to discover myself, and I was a woman.</p><p>All around was blackness and no-sound. With my hands I felt old crusts of rock. There was an ancient bitter smell without a name pressing into my nostrils. I crawled out of the recess I had been lying in, and found a sort of passage where I could stand upright. Oddly, I did not wonder if I was blind. It was cold and airless as I felt a way along the passage. My foot struck hard on an obstruction. I kneeled and felt it carefully. A step, followed by other steps, hewn out roughly from the inner rock, and not much trodden. I could remember abruptly other staircases, made of smooth veined white stuff, slippery almost as glass, deeply indented at their center from countless feet passing up and down.</p><p>I went cautiously up the steps, feeling always with my hands. I did not think to count them, but there were many, at least a hundred. And then a flat space without steps. Foolishly I had quickened my pace, thankful to be on level ground, but I was punished. Suddenly there was no more stone in front, only an unsensable void. I swayed like a dancer on the brink of the invisible drop, then flung backward and saved myself. A skitter of stones fell down into the blackness. I heard them falling for a long time, bouncing often against the walls.</p><p>I was terrified now. How could I go on without seeing? The next mistake might be fatal, and already, without even knowing who I was, I knew my life was important to me. I sensed, too, something fighting against me in the dark, a malignant, one-sided battle, and I feared it and was angry.</p><p>On hands and knees I went forward very slowly, away to the left of the drop. After a moment, my outstretched hand clawed at emptiness. I turned back, going to the right. A few seconds, and the third corner of the abyss was sucking at my grasp.</p><p>I was filled with fury. I screamed out a curse in the dark, and the sound echoed and echoed until I thought the rock would split in pieces.</p><p>Where now? Perhaps there was nowhere. I lay on the ledge and wept, and then curled again, like an animal or a fetus, and slept. That was the end of my first awakening.</p><p>* * *</p><p>The second time was better. The original sleep had been no normal sleeping; this was, and I woke with a different awareness of things.</p><p>I reasoned in the dark that if the staircase ended in nothing, then I would have to go back down the stairs to the passage, and retrace my steps until I found some other way. It occurred to me then, for the first time, that I was seeking the surface, with an instinctive knowledge of being underground.</p><p>Crawling back across the platform to the stairs, my hands and then my knees encountered a square dip in the rock. I searched it and discovered a seam. This must be a door. Even while I was trying to find some way to open it, it slipped suddenly inward. I found myself, still in absolute blackness, hanging over another unguessable void, my scrabbling fingertips clutching at one smooth edge of the door. There was no hope. My fingers lost their grip and I fell. I thought that was the end of it, but the drop was not very far. I hit the stone floor, and rolled, loose-limbed enough that I did myself no harm.</p><p>I turned around slowly, and now, unmistakably, there was the merest glimmer of light, far off, at the end of what seemed another long passageway. Drawn by that light, I set off quickly, almost running.</p><p>Now I could see the dim outline of the rock sides, and the little veins of glitter in them. The passage wound and wound, and the glow deepened and bloodied. Then abruptly I had turned a corner and threw up my hands to shield my eyes.</p><p>The light was as blinding as the darkness, but soon I could rub away the tears and look around me.</p><p>I was in a vast cavern, lit only at its center where a great, rough-hewn bowl, at least six feet in diameter, poured out a ceaseless storm of red and golden flame. Beyond the fire a flight of steps ran up to a narrow door high in the wall. Otherwise the cavern seemed featureless and empty.</p><p>Somehow the narrow door was important to me, and I knew I must reach it.</p><p>I started out across the floor, suddenly aware of how the cavern, stretching up endlessly into darkness, dwarfed me like an ant. I passed the flame-bowl, had my foot on the first stair. There was a groaning thunder behind me. I swung around and looked in astonishment. Countless little fires had cracked open the cavern floor, and were blazing there. At the next step, fresh flames burst through. Not stopping to see any more, I ran to the top of the stairs, as if speed could outwit the mechanism below. With my hand on the narrow door, I glanced back. The floor where I had walked was now a sea of savage gold, and the scarlet smoke clouded up and turned to purple in the high roof. I pushed the door and ran through when it opened, thrusting it shut behind me.</p><p>The room was full of light, though it seemed to have no source. In front of me was a long hanging curtain, and when I pulled it aside, a stone altar and another stone bowl, where something stirred and brooded at my presence. I could not see this thing, only sense it, and when it spoke, I did not hear the words except with the ears inside my head.</p><p>&#x201c;And so you could not sleep forever. I knew that you must wake one day, for all the sleep I gave you. Wake, and come to me. Even the abyss could not take you, as I hoped. Well, then. I will tell you things. I am Karrakaz, the Soulless One, who sprang from the evil of y...</p></p><h2>Acts of the Apostles : An Introduction and Commentary</h2><p>Marshall&#39;s commentary on the Book of Acts is a contribution to the Tyndale New Testament Commentaries, a popular study aid designed to help the general Bible reader understand clearly what the text actually says and what it means without going into scholarly technicalities.</p><p>I. Howard Marshall (1934-2015) was a world-renowned New Testament scholar and the author or editor of at least thirty-eight books and more than 120 essays and articles. He taught New Testament at the University of Aberdeen for thirty-five years and was a professor emeritus for sixteen years. Among his numerous publications on the New Testament are his commentaries on the Gospel of Luke, Acts, 1-2 Thessalonians, the Pastoral Epistles and 1 Peter and 1-3 John. He is coauthor of <em>Exploring the New Testament: A Guide to the Letters and Revelation</em> and coeditor of the New International Greek Testament Commentary series, as well as the author of the series' volume on Luke. He has also authored <em>New Testament Theology: Many Witnesses, One Gospel.</em> Marshall was an evangelical Methodist who was born and lived most of his life in Scotland. He received a PhD from the University of Aberdeen and a DD from Asbury Theological Seminary."The Tyndale volumes have long been the premier shorter-length commentary series on both Testaments throughout the English-speaking world." (Craig Blomberg, Denver Seminary)<br><br>"Tyndale commentaries are always useful, not least because they focus so clearly on the text of Scripture, and do not fall into the trap of paying too much attention to other commentaries and not enough to the scriptural text they are intended to expound and explain. So they retain their usefulness for preachers, Bible study leaders and for all readers of the Bible." (Peter Adam, principal, Ridley College, Melbourne, Australia)<br><br>"Within its constraints, this series includes some outstanding volumes." (D. A. Carson, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School)<br><br>"There simply is no series of medium-length commentaries that approaches the excellence of the Tyndale commentaries." (Donald A.

He is the winner of the Edogawa Rampo Prize (for best mystery), the Mystery Writers of Japan, Inc. Prize (for best mystery) among others. His novels are translated widely throughout Asia. <p></p>ALEXANDER O. SMITH has translated a broad variety of novels, manga, and video games, for which he has been nominated for the Eisner Award, and won the ALA&#x2019;s Batchelder Award (for his translation of Miyuki Miyabe&#x2019;s <i>Brave Story</i>), and been recognized for his localizations of the video games Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy XII. He lives with his family in Vermont.<p>Chapter One</p><p>At 7:35 A.M. Ishigami left his apartment as he did every weekday morning. Just before stepping out onto the street, he glanced at the mostly full bicycle lot, noting the absence of the green bi�cycle. Though it was already March, the wind was bitingly cold. He walked with his head down, burying his chin in his scarf. A short way to the south, about twenty yards, ran Shin-Ohashi Road. From that intersection the road ran east into the Edogawa dis�trict, west toward Nihonbashi. Just before Nihonbashi, it crossed the Sumida River at the Shin-Ohashi Bridge. </p><p>The quickest route from Ishigami&#x2019;s apartment to his work�place was due south. It was only a quarter mile or so to Seicho Garden Park. He worked at the private high school just before the park. He was a teacher. He taught math. </p><p>Ishigami walked south to the red light at the intersection, then he turned right, toward Shin-Ohashi Bridge. The wind blew in his face, making his coat flap around him. He thrust his hands deep into his pockets and hunched over, quickening his pace. </p><p>A thick layer of clouds covered the sky, their gray reflection making the Sumida River look even murkier than usual. A small boat was making its way upstream. Ishigami noted its progress as he crossed the bridge. </p><p>On the other side, he took a set of stairs that led from the foot of the bridge down to the Sumida. Passing beneath the iron struts of the bridge, he began to walk along the river. Pedestrian walkways were built into the molded concrete riverbanks on both sides of the water. Further down, near Kiyosu Bridge, families and couples often strolled along the river, but such people seldom vis�ited the riverbanks this far up. The long row of cardboard shan�ties covered in blue vinyl sheets kept them away. This was where the homeless lived, in the shadow of an expressway overpass that ran along the west side of the river. Ishigami figured the looming overpass must have provided some shelter from the wind and rain. The fact that not a single shack stood on the other side of the river gave weight to this hypothesis, though it was possible the first squatters had settled there by accident and the others had simply followed them, preferring the safety of their community, such as it was, to solitude across the water. </p><p>He made his way down the row of shanties, glancing briefly at them as he walked. Most were barely tall enough for a man to stand up inside, and some of the structures only rose as high as his waist. They were more boxes than shacks. Maybe it was enough to have a place to sleep. </p><p>Plastic laundry hangers had been rigged up near the boxes, signs of domestic life. A man was leaning up against the railing that ran between the walkway and the water, brushing his teeth. Ishigami had seen him around. He was past sixty, and his gray�ish white hair was bound in a long ponytail. He had probably given up on work. If it was physical labor he wanted, he wouldn&#x2019;t have been hanging around now. Those jobs were filled in the early morning hours. He wouldn&#x2019;t be going to the unemploy�ment office, either. Even if they did find a job suitable for him, with that long hair of his he&#x2019;d never make it as far as the inter�view. The chances of anyone wanting him for a job at his age were close to zero anyway. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Another man stood near his sleeping box, crushing a row of empty cans under his foot. Ishigami had witnessed this scene sev�eral times before, and he had secretly named this fellow the Can Man. The Can Man looked to be around fifty. He had good clothes and even a bicycle. Ishigami figured that his can-collecting trips kept him more active and alert than the others. He lived at the edge of the community, deep under the bridge, which must have been a position of privilege. The Can Man was a village elder, then&#x2014;an old-timer, even in this crowd&#x2014;or so Ishigami saw him. </p><p>A little way on from where the line of cardboard shanties petered out, another man was sitting on a bench. His coat must have once been beige, but now it was scuffed and gray. He was wearing a suit jacket underneath it, though, and beneath that a white work shirt. Ishigami guessed that he had a necktie stashed away in his coat pocket. Ishigami had labeled him the Engineer a few days earlier, after spotting him reading an industrial trade magazine. He kept his hair cropped short, and he shaved. Maybe he hoped he&#x2019;d be going back to work soon. He would be off to the unemployment office today, but he probably wouldn&#x2019;t find a job. He would have to lose his pride before that happened. Ishi�gami had first seen the Engineer about ten days ago. He wasn&#x2019;t used to life along the river yet, still drawing an imaginary line between himself and the blue vinyl sheets. Yet here he stayed, not knowing how to live on his own without a home. </p><p>Ishigami continued walking along the river. Just before Kiyosu Bridge, he came upon an elderly woman taking three dogs for a walk. The dogs were miniature dachshunds, each with a different colored collar, one red, one blue, and one pink. As he approached, the woman seemed to notice him. She smiled and nodded. He nodded in reply. </p><p>&#x201c;Good morning,&#x201d; he offered. </p><p>&#x201c;Good morning. Cold, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Quite,&#x201d; he replied, grimacing for effect. </p><p>The old woman bade him a good day as she passed by, and he gave her a final nod. </p><p>Some days before, Ishigami had seen the woman carrying a plastic convenience store bag with something like sandwiches in it&#x2014;probably her breakfast. He surmised from this that she lived alone. Her home wouldn&#x2019;t be far from here. She was wearing flip-flops, and she wouldn&#x2019;t be able to drive a car in those. She had probably lost her husband years before and now lived in a nearby apartment with her three dogs. A big place, if she was keeping three dogs there. No doubt her pets had kept her from moving to a smaller room somewhere. Maybe she had already paid off the mortgage, but there would still be maintenance fees, so she had to scrimp and save. She hadn&#x2019;t been to the beauty salon once this winter. Her hair showed its natural color, free from dye. </p><p>At the foot of Kiyosu Bridge, Ishigami climbed the stairs back up to the road. The school was across the bridge from here, but he turned and walked in the opposite direction. </p><p>A sign facing the road read &#x201c;Benten-tei.&#x201d; Beneath it was a small shop that made boxed lunches. Ishigami slid open the aluminum- framed glass door. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Good morning! Come in, come in,&#x201d; came the call. It was a familiar greeting and a familiar voice, but it somehow always managed to put a spring in his step. Yasuko Hanaoka smiled at him from behind the counter. She was wearing a white hat. </p><p>Ishigami felt another thrill as he realized that there were no other customers in the shop. They were alone. </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take the special.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;One special, coming up,&#x201d; she replied brightly. Ishigami couldn&#x2019;t see her expression as he was staring into his wallet, unable to look her in the face. Given that they lived next door to each other, Ishigami felt like he should have something to talk about other than his boxed lunch order, but nothing came to mind. </p><p>When he finally came up with &#x201c;Cold today, isn&#x2019;t it,&#x201d; he mumbled the words, and they were lost in the sound of another customer opening the sliding glass door behind him. Yasuko&#x2019;s attention had turned to the new arrival. </p><p>Boxed lunch in hand, Ishigami walked out of the store. This time, he headed straight for Kiyosu Bridge, his detour to Benten- tei finished. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After the morning rush, things slowed down at Benten-tei, at least as far as customers were concerned. In the back, however, there were lunches to be made. Several local companies had the shop deliver meals for all their employees by twelve o&#x2019;clock. So, when the customers stopped coming, Yasuko would go back into the kitchen to lend a hand. </p><p>There were four employees at Benten-tei. Yonazawa was the manager, assisted by his wife Sayoko. Kaneko, a part-timer, was responsible for making deliveries, while Yasuko dealt with all the in-shop customers. </p><p>Before her current job, Yasuko had worked in a nightclub in Kinshicho. Yonazawa had been a regular there and Sayoko had been the club&#x2019;s <i>mama</i>&#x2014; though Yasuko hadn&#x2019;t known they were married until just before Sayoko quit. </p><p>&#x201c;She wants to go from being the <i>mama</i> at a bar to the good wife at a lunch shop,&#x201d; Yonazawa had told her. &#x201c;Can you believe it? Some people never fail to surprise me.&#x201d; Rumors had begun to fly at the club, but according to Sayoko, it had been the couple&#x2019;s long-held dream to run a place of their own. She had only been working at the club to save up for that. </p><p>After Benten-tei opened, Yasuko had made a habit of drop�ping in now and then to see how the two were doing. Business was apparently good&#x2014;good enough that, a year later, they asked her if she&#x2019;d be interested in helping out. It had become too much for the two of them to handle on their own. </p><p>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t go on in that shady business forever, Yasuko,&#x201d; Say�oko had told her. &#x201c;Besides, Misato&#x2019;s getting bigger. You wouldn&#x2019;t want her developing a complex because her mom&#x2019;s a nightclub hostess. Of course,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d added, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s none of my business.&#x201d; </p><p>Misato was Yasuko&#x2019;s only daughter. There was no father in her life after Yasuko&#x2019;s last divorce, five years ago. Yasuko hadn&#x2019;t needed Sayoko to tell her she couldn&#x2019;t go on as she was. Besides her daughter&#x2019;s welfare, there was her own age to consider. It was far from clear how long she could have kept her job even if she wanted it. </p><p>It only took her a day to come to a decision, and the club didn&#x2019;t even try to hold on to her. They had just wished her well, and that was all. Apparently she hadn&#x2019;t been the only one con�cerned about her future there. </p><p>She had moved into her current apartment in the spring a year ago, which coincided with Misato entering junior high school. Her old place was too far from her new job. And, unlike the club, get�ting to her new work on time meant getting up by six and being on her bicycle by six thirty. Her green bicycle. </p><p>&#x201c;That high school teacher come again today?&#x201d; Sayoko asked her during a break. </p><p>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t he come every day?&#x201d; Yasuko replied, catching Say�oko sharing a grin with her husband. &#x201c;What? What&#x2019;s that for?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Oh nothing, nothing. We were just saying the other day how we thought he might fancy you.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Whaaat?&#x201d; Yasuko leaned back from the table, a cup of tea in her hand. </p><p>&#x201c;You were off yesterday, weren&#x2019;t you? Well, guess what? He didn&#x2019;t come in yesterday. Don&#x2019;t you think it&#x2019;s strange that he should come every day, except for the days when you&#x2019;re not here?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s a coincidence.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Well, we think maybe it&#x2019;s not.&#x201d; Sayoko glanced again at her husband. </p><p>Yonazawa nodded, still grinning. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been going on for a while now,&#x201d; he said with a nod at his wife. &#x201c;&#x2018;Every day that Yas�uko&#x2019;s out, he doesn&#x2019;t come here for his lunch,&#x2019; she says. I&#x2019;d won�dered about it myself, to tell the truth, and when he didn&#x2019;t show yesterday, that kind of confirmed it for me.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t have any set vacations, other than the days the whole shop is closed. It&#x2019;s not like I&#x2019;m out every Monday or some�thing obvious like that.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Which makes it even more suspicious!&#x201d; Sayoko concluded, a twinkle in her eye. &#x201c;He lives next door to you, doesn&#x2019;t he? He must see you leave for work. That&#x2019;s how he knows.&#x201d; </p><p>Yasuko shook her head. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;ve never met him on my way out, not even once.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Maybe he&#x2019;s watching you from someplace. A window, maybe?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think he can see my door from his window.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;In any case, if he is interested, he&#x2019;ll say something sooner or later,&#x201d; Yonazawa said. &#x201c;As far as we&#x2019;re concerned, we have a regu�lar customer thanks to you, so it&#x2019;s good news for us. Looks like your training in Kinshicho paid off.&#x201d; </p><p>Yasuko gave a wry smile and drank down the rest of her tea, thinking about the high school teacher. </p><p>His name was Ishigami. She had gone to his apartment the night she moved in to introduce herself. That&#x2019;s when she&#x2019;d learned he was a teacher. He was a heavyset man, with a big, round face that made his small eyes look thin as threads. His hair was thin�ning and cut short, making him look nearly fifty, though he might easily have been much younger. He wasn&#x2019;t particularly fashion conscious, always wearing the same sort of clothes. This winter, when he came in to buy his lunch, he was wearing the same coat over a brown sweater. Still, he did do his laundry, as was evidenced by the occasional presence of a drying rack on the small balcony of his apartment. He was single and, Yasuko guessed, not a divorc� or widower. </p><p>She thought back, trying to remember something that might have clued her in to his interest, but came up with nothing. He was like the thin crack in her apartment wall. She knew it was there, but she had never paid it that much attention.

When Serina Daeth, favorite concubine of the Elf-Lord Dyran, conceives a half-blood child by him, she flees his wrath into the desert, where she quickly succumbs. But the child, born in Serina's dying moments, is rescued by a friendly dragon and raised with her own draconic brood. As the child Shana grows, she develops prodigious sorcerous powers--so strong that it seems she might be the fabled Elvenbane, powerful enough to free the enslaved humans from their elven oppressors. The dragons come to fear her unplumbed power, though, and cast her out. With a renegade elf-lord and his half-blood servant, and the aid of her remaining dragon friends, Shana prepares to challenge the elfish supremacy. Though battle is joined, a sequel is plainly on the way. Thoroughly rooted in genre traditions--with elves, dragons, unicorns, and sorcerers--but some variations make it more enjoyable than the average example: theses elves and unicorns, for instance, are cruel and dangerous, where in most fantasies they are shining examples of superhuman purity. Overall, then, despite shallow characters and a lack of real tension (we never doubt that Shana and friends will succeed), an entertaining adventure. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>SF master Norton ( The Crystal Gryphon and the Witch World series) and her new collaborator Lackey ( Arrows of the Queen and subsequent volumes of the Valdemar series) have produced a fine coming-of-age adventure in which a decadent elven society maintains a cruel, avaricious control over the shattered remnants of humanity while shape-changing dragons covertly observe. Pregnant with a half-breed child, a human concubine of the almost immortal elven Lord Dyran flees into the desert to avoid death. She is found by the dragon Alara, a shaman herself heavy with egg. Although the concubine dies, Alara saves the child Shana and brings her home to foster with her own son Keman. When Shana reaches adulthood and is cast out by conservative dragons, she learns the extent of her magical abilities. Aided by Keman and her full-elven half-brother, Dyran's heir, she leads a revolt by the other hidden half-breeds against the tyranny of the elves. With excellent evocations of dragon lore and society, this tale will rank as one of the season's liveliest and most appealing fantasy epics. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Love Flute</h2><p>In love with a beautiful girl, but too shy to summon the courage to tell her, a young man leaves his camp in frustration.

Weil (1909-43) displayed early the ferocious intellect that took this daughter of affluent, highly assimilated French Jews to the peak of her country's rigorous educational system and made her an important modern philosopher. But Weil remains a beacon to activists because of her passionate, intensely personal commitment to the world's oppressed and her need to directly share their sufferings. This need had its neurotic aspects, and Gray's elegant biography does not gloss over Weil's lifelong anorexia, her distaste for physical contact, her peculiar brand of anti-Semitism, or the unyielding self-righteousness that led her to cut off friendships for minor offenses. Yet the overall tone is one of sympathetic respect for an extraordinary human being unable to develop the willed blindness that enables most of us to live comfortably while others go without. Weil gave up prestigious teaching jobs to do manual labor; she performed dangerous work in the Resistance; and, when threatened by a Vichy policeman who exclaimed angrily, "You little bitch, we'll have you thrown in jail with the whores!" she replied coolly, "I've always wanted to know that milieu." Her slow, exceedingly tentative movement toward Christianity grew from her need to affirm her solidarity with the world's "slaves," and her prescient denunciation of Communism at a time when most radicals embraced it arose from her understanding that Soviet apparatchiks abused the working class just as egregiously as their putative opponents, the fascists. This is an outstanding introduction for general readers to the influential thought and rivetingly conflicted life of a seminal figure in 20th-century intellectual history. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Francine du Plessix Gray is the author of <i>Rage and Fire</i>, <i>Lovers and Tyrants</i>, <i>Soviet Women</i>, and the Pulitzer Prize finalist <i>At Home with the Marquis de Sade</i>.</p><h2>Nothing But The Truth: Selected Dispatches</h2><p>Before her murder in 2006, Anna Politkovskaya won international fame for her reporting. <b>Nothing But the Truth</b> is a collection of her best writing.<br><br>Beginning with a brief introduction by the author about her pariah status, <b>Nothing But the Truth</b> contains material which characterizes the self-effacing Politkovskaya more fully than she allowed in her other books.

In addition to the lingering spirits of the dead, I see one other kind of supernatural entity. I call them <i>bodachs</i>.<br><br>They are ink-black, fluid in shape, with no more substance than shadows. Soundless, as big as an average man, they frequently slink like cats, low to the ground.<br><br>The one on the abbey lawn moved upright: black and featureless, yet suggestive of something half man, half wolf. Sleek, sinuous, and sinister.<br><br>The grass was not disturbed by its passage. Had it been crossing water, it would not have left a single ripple in its wake.<br><br>In the folklore of the British Isles, a bodach is a vile beast that slithers down chimneys at night and carries off children who misbehave. Rather like Inland Revenue agents.<br><br>What I see are neither bodachs nor tax collectors. They carry away neither misbehaving children nor adult miscreants. But I have seen them enter houses by chimneys&#x2013;by keyholes, chinks in window frames, as protean as smoke&#x2013;and I have no better name for them.<br><br>Their infrequent appearance is always reason for alarm. These creatures seem to be spiritual vampires with knowledge of the future. They are drawn to places where violence or fiery catastrophe is destined to erupt, as if they feed on human suffering.<br><br>Although he was a brave dog, with good reason to be brave, Boo shrank from the passing apparition. His black lips peeled back from his white fangs.<br><br>The phantom paused as if to taunt the dog. Bodachs seem to know that some animals can see them.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t think they know that I can see them, too. If they did know, I believe that they would show me less mercy than mad mullahs show their victims when in a mood to behead and dismember.<br><br>At the sight of this one, my first impulse was to shrink from the window and seek communion with the dust bunnies under my bed. My second impulse was to pee.<br><br>Resisting both cowardice and the call of the bladder, I raced from my quarters into the hallway. The third floor of the guesthouse offers two small suites.

The solid construction of the abbey would not translate my footfalls into his dreams.<br><br>The guesthouse has an enclosed spiral staircase, stone walls encircling granite steps. The treads alternate between black and white, making me think of harlequins and piano keys, and of a treacly old song by Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder.<br><br>Although stone stairs are unforgiving and the black-and-white pattern can be disorienting, I plunged toward the ground floor, risking damage to the granite if I fell and struck it with my head.<br><br>Sixteen months ago, I lost what was most precious to me and found my world in ruins; nevertheless, I am not usually reckless. I have less to live for than I once did, but my life still has purpose, and I struggle to find meaning in the days.<br><br>Leaving the stairs in the condition that I found them, I hurried across the main parlor, where only a night lamp with a beaded shade relieved the gloom. I pushed through a heavy oak door with a stained-glass window, and saw my breath plume before me in the winter night.<br><br>The guesthouse cloister surrounds a courtyard with a reflecting pool and a white marble statue of St. Bartholomew.

I detected, instead, the faintest smell of ozone, as after lightning in a spring rain, and wondered about it, but kept moving.<br><br>I followed the colonnade to the door of the guesthouse receiving room, went inside, crossed that shadowy chamber, and returned to the December night through the front door of the abbey.<br><br>Our white shepherd mix, Boo, standing on the driveway, as I had last seen him from my third-floor window, turned his head to look at me as I descended the broad front steps.

My life is strange but not so strange that it includes talking canines.<br><br>With wary purpose, however, the dog moved off the driveway, onto the yard.

The hydrogen bomb, the South African Government, Chiang Kai-shek, Senator McCarthy himself, would then seem a light price to pay for no longer being in the Middle Ages. Had people ever been as nasty, as self-indulgent, as dull, as miserable, as cocksure, as bad at art, as dismally ludicrous, or as wrong as they'd been in . . . the Middle Ages?" I reread "Lucky Jim" every year or so as a spiritual tonic; that's how I came to connect Jim's pronouncement with Laura Joh Rowland's new mystery, "The Cloud Pavilion," the 14th novel in a series dealing with crime in feudal Japan. Though I suspect fans of this long-running series probably like it for the visions it conjures of the bygone civilization of samurai and shogun, there's little to pine for in Japan circa 1701 -- at least as depicted here. Peasants are eviscerated without reason at the whim of nobles; orphans run wild in the muddy streets; and women are mere baubles to be bought, traded and abused for men's pleasure. Even the food sounds bad: lots of raw mackerel and rice for those lucky enough to afford it. Still less appetizing are the crimes. The novel opens with a short, graphic rape scene, told from the point of view of the terrified victim. As the story unfolds, more women are kidnapped and violated in the city of Edo, among them: a gangster's adolescent daughter, a 60-year-old nun and a young mother who is also the cousin of Rowland's series hero, samurai detective Sano Ichiro. Initiating an investigation out of duty to his family, Sano is stymied by the fact that, in each case, he receives a starkly different description of the rapist. Are the attacks even related? Why does one of the victims tell such a strange story about being surrounded by roiling gray clouds? And -- on an unrelated note -- why is Sano's longtime mortal enemy and competitor for the shogun's favor, Yanagisawa, being sweet as pie to him since returning from exile? As a mystery, "The Cloud Pavilion" is as bumpy as an edamame pod. While the crimes (and punishments) described here are vicious and the vision of life in Edo outside the shogun's gates is grim, the relationship between Sano and his mystery-loving wife, Reiko, is cozily akin to that of Nick and Nora Charles -- minus the cocktails and repartee. In a Betty Friedan moment early in the novel, Reiko chafes against her cloistered existence: "At first she'd been thankful for the peace and quiet. She'd been glad that Yanagisawa apparently didn't intend to continue his hostilities against Sano. She wanted only to raise her family without fear. . . . She'd become very domestic taking up feminine activities such as flower arranging. . . . But enough was enough. . . . She wasn't meant for the circumscribed existence that was normal for women of her class. She missed the days . . . when she'd helped Sano solve crimes. . . . She was eager to take on a new investigation. But how? And when?" As that snippet from Reiko's musings illustrates, Rowland's writing is sometimes clunky. Reiko's portentous questions reminded this reader of similar itchy-to-be-doing-something sentiments in the Nancy Drew novels. And Rowland's tic of frequently harking back to earlier adventures in the Sano series deepens the Nancy Drew analogy. All long-running series have to deal with the challenge of a double readership consisting of fans who've read every previous entry and novices coming to the world of the established detective for the first time. In this case, Rowland's catch-up references feel intrusive, like authorial elbow jabs. Like Jim Dixon with regard to the Middle Ages, readers of "The Cloud Pavilion" will probably come away grateful for modernity, however compromised its advantages. Nothing in this so-so mystery novel will entice readers to linger in 18th-century Japan. bookworld@washpost.com <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

For more than two decades, young black kids have been disappearing from Richmond's East End. No bodies have ever been found, and the missing boys haven't received much attention from police or the media. When the uncle of the latest missing kid takes matters into his own hands and holds the daily newspaper's publisher hostage in the paper's lobby, Willie Black gets involved, and things start to change.<br><br>The world's oldest night cops reporter knows something about the inequities of race and income. When Sam McNish, a crusader for social justice who grew up in the same hardscrabble Oregon Hill neighborhood as Willie, is arrested shortly after a child's body is discovered, the police start making the case that McNish has been the demonic force behind all the boys' disappearances.<br><br>Willie, after working the traps he's developed from his too-many years as a reporter, isn't so sure. <br><br>As Willie teases out the real story, he manages to antagonize his publisher and the city's power structure as well as police chief L.D. Jones, but experience has taught him that the more people he angers, the closer he probably is to the truth. Along the way, he forms a strange alliance with Big Boy Sunday, a dangerous man who exhibits a strong interest in seeing that Willie finds the truth--although Willie will learn that Big Boy wants parts of that truth to remain hidden.</p><p>Howard Owen, a veteran newspaper editor, lives in Richmond, Va., with his wife, Karen Van Neste Owen. This is his 14th novel and the fifth Willie Black mystery. The first, <i>Oregon Hill</i>, won the Dashiell Hammett Prize for best crime literature in the U.S. and Canada. It was followed by <i>The Philadelphia Quarry</i>, <i>Parker Field</i> and <i>The Bottom</i>. Owen's earlier works include <i>Littlejohn</i>, <i>Fat Lightning</i>, <i>Rock of Ages</i> and <i>The Reckoning</i>."Proof positive that despite the title of police reporter Willie Black's fifth appearance, things can indeed get worse for both the city of Richmond and its daily newspaper. A good kid named Artesian Cole has gone missing and the police don't seem to care. Willie's instincts suggest that Artesian may be only the latest in a series of disappearances of young black males stretching back 20 years. A second murder clarifies things for Willie, but in ways that don't sit at all well with his publisher, and the race is on between his attempts to gather new evidence and her attempts to shut him down for good. Owen uses his reflective, self-destructive hero to illuminate both the racial problems of his hometown and the ongoing death of the newspaper he loves, even though it doesn't love him back." --<b>Kirkus Reviews</b><br><br>"The first half of Owen's novel jumbles Willie's problems with work, family, women, and the twenty-first century, and readers who may begin wondering what became of the crime novel in all this will be nicely surprised. Suddenly the narrative acquires a stronger pulse, turning Willie's search for the killers into a tense narrative. He beats the TV types, "the good-hair people," to the murderers, but what<br>he does when he finds them is another matter altogether. A strong entry in the reporter-sleuth subgenre." --<b>Booklist</b><br><br>"Thanks to an anonymous tip received by police chief Larry Jones, the prime suspect is preacher Sam McNish, whose church runs the tutoring program Artesian attended. When Willie talks to Laquinta Cole, Artesian's mother, he hears about other boys who have gone missing and a boogie man called Frosty. Laquinta's boyfriend, tough guy Big Boy Sunday, puts pressure on Willie to discover the truth, as does Dominick when he turns his attention to a former city councilman's murder. Willie walks a tightrope keeping Sunday, Jones, and Dominick at bay while trying to find justice for the missing boys." --<b>Publishers Weekly</b></p><h2>Dear Ghosts,: Poems</h2><p><p><b>The long-awaited and resplendent new poetry collection by Tess Gallagher, whose poems "are a gift of a poet's heart and soul to her readers" (Robert Coles)</b></p><br><p><i>Don't sharpen them.</i><br><i>Expectation, more dangerous</i><br><i>than any blade.</i><br><i>&#x2015;"Knives in the Borrowed House"</i></p><p>Fourteen years after <i>Moon Crossing Bridge</i>&#x2015;Tess Gallagher's powerful elegies for her husband, Raymond Carver&#x2015;<i>Dear Ghosts</i>, is the return of Gallagher's unequivocal voice. In these new poems, the ghosts of the past are conjured as part of the present day: the deceased beloved, the father long dead, the ailing mother, the victims of holocaust and war. With these spirits beside her, Gallagher confronts her own illness and mortality, and celebrates love and friendship in these spare lyrics and muscular narratives, each punctuated by her resilience and grace. Here is the new work by one of America's most accomplished poets.</p></p><p><p><b>Tess Gallagher </b>is a poet, fiction writer, essayist, screenplay writer, and translator. Her previous poetry collections include <i>Moon Crossing Bridge </i>and <i>Amplitude: New and Selected Poems</i>. She lives in Port Angeles, Washington.</p>*Starred Review* Gallagher, a cherished poet and short story writer, evokes the power of the unseen as well as the seen with breathtaking clarity, creating metaphors so surprising, radiant, and apt that the world seems to expand in their wake. This sense of opening is intrinsic to Gallagher's new poems. Substantial yet lambent, earthy and spiritual, these are her best works in an already incandescent oeuvre. The collection begins with "My Unopened Life," a poem charged with fairy-tale magic as a place setting on a tablecloth acquires cosmic dimension. In another worlds-within-world poem, "Oil Spot," Gallagher writes, "The door to beauty always / stands open." The indiscriminate wounds of war are the subject of startlingly precise reflections on her World War II-era childhood and on the Vietnam War, and both life and death are palpably present in ravishing poems of Vancouver, Ireland, Romania, and Egypt. Losing her hair during cancer treatments summons up contrasting visions of the women of Auschwitz and Buddhist monks. Gallagher remembers her mother and her late husband, Raymond Carver, and finds enlightenment in birds, the moon, rain, dusk, and lilacs. So compelling are Gallagher's graceful poems, they leave the reader feeling "rearranged from the cells out." <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

He owes much of his success to Chevie, a seventeen-year-old FBI agent who traveled from the future in a time pod and helped him defeat his murderous master, Albert Garrick. But it is difficult for Riley to enjoy his new life, for he has always believed that Garrick will someday, somehow, return to seek vengeance.<br><br>Chevie has assured Riley that Garrick was sucked into a temporal wormhole, never to emerge. The full nature of the wormhole has never been understood, however, and just as a human body will reject an unsuitable transplant, the wormhole eventually spat him out. By the time Garrick makes it back to Victorian London, he has been planning his revenge on Riley for centuries. But even the best-laid plans can go awry, and when the three are tossed once more into the wormhole, they end up in a highly paranoid Puritan village where everything is turned upside down. Chevie is accused of being a witch, Garrick is lauded as the town's protector, and . . . is that a talking dog?

And it&#39;s why, when Dr Walid called me to the morgue to listen to a corpse, I recognised the tune it was playing. Something violently supernatural had happened to the victim, strong enough to leave its imprint like a wax cylinder recording. Cyrus Wilkinson, part-time jazz saxophonist and full-time accountant, had apparently dropped dead of a heart attack just after finishing a gig in a Soho jazz club. He wasn&#39;t the first. No one was going to let me exhume corpses to see if they were playing my tune, so it was back to old-fashioned legwork, starting in Soho, the heart of the scene. I didn&#39;t trust the lovely Simone, Cyrus&#39; ex-lover, professional jazz kitten and as inviting as a Rubens&#39; portrait, but I needed her help: there were monsters stalking Soho, creatures feeding off that special gift that separates the great musician from someone who can raise a decent tune. What they take is beauty. What they leave behind is sickness, failure and broken lives. And as I hunted them, my investigation got tangled up in another story: a brilliant trumpet player, Richard &#39;Lord&#39; Grant - my father - who managed to destroy his own career, twice. That&#39;s the thing about policing: most of the time you&#39;re doing it to maintain public order. Occasionally you&#39;re doing it for justice. And maybe once in a career, you&#39;re doing it for revenge.</p><p>Ben Aaronovitch&#39;s work reflects his abiding fascination and love for what he modestly likes to refer to as the &#39;Capital of the World&#39;, where he was born and raised. He works as a London bookseller when he is not writing novels and TV scripts.chapter 1<br><br>Body and Soul<br><br>It&#x2019;s a sad fact of modern life that if you drive long enough, sooner or later you must leave London behind. If you drive northeast up the A12 you eventually come to Colchester, Britain&#x2019;s first Roman capital and the first city to be burned down by that redheaded chavette from Norfolk known as Boudicca. I knew all this because I&#x2019;d been reading the Annals of Tacitus as part of my Latin training. He&#x2019;s surprisingly sympathetic to the revolting Brits and scathing about the unpreparedness of the Roman generals who thought more of what was agreeable than expedient. The classically educated chinless wonders who run the British army obviously took this admonition to heart because Col?chester is now the home of their toughest soldiers&#x2014;the parachute regiment. Having spent many a Saturday night as a probationary PC wrestling squaddie in Leicester Square, I made sure I stayed on the main road and bypassed the city altogether.<br><br>Beyond Colchester I turned south and, with the help of the GPS on my phone, got myself onto the B1029 heading down the wedged-shaped bit of dry ground jammed between the River Colne and Flag Creek. At the end of the road lay Brightlingsea&#x2013;lining the coast, so Leslie had always told me, like a collection of rubbish stranded at the high-water mark. Actually I didn&#x2019;t think it was that bad. It had been raining in London but after Colchester I&#x2019;d driven into clear blue skies and the sun lit up the rows of well-kept Victorian terraces that ran down to the sea.<br><br>Chez May was easy to spot, a 1970s brick-built fake Edwardian cottage that had been carriage-lamped and pebble-dashed within an inch of its life. The front door was flanked on one side by a hanging basket full of blue flowers and on the other by the house number inscribed on a ceramic plate in the shape of a sailing yacht. I paused and checked the garden; there were gnomes loitering near the ornamental birdbath. I took a breath and rang the doorbell.<br><br>There was an immediate chorus of female yelling from inside. Through the reproduction stained-glass window in the front door I could just make out blurry figures running back and forth at the far end of the hall. Somebody yelled, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s your boyfriend!&#x201d; which earned a shush and a sotto voce reprimand from someone else. A white blur marched up the hallway until it filled the view through the window from side to side. I took a step backward and the door opened. It was Henry May&#x2014;Leslie&#x2019;s father.<br><br>He was a large man, and driving big trucks and hauling heavy gear had given him broad shoulders and heavily muscled arms. Too many transport caf� breakfasts and standing his round at the pub had put a tire around his waist. He had a square face and had dealt with a receding hairline by shaving his hair down to a brown fuzz. His eyes were blue and clever. Leslie had gotten her eyes from her dad.<br><br>Having four daughters meant that he had parental looming down to a fine art, and I fought the urge to ask whether Leslie could come out and play.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello, Peter,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. May,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>He made no effort to unblock the doorway; nor did he invite me in.<br><br>&#x201c;Leslie will be out in a minute,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;She all right?&#x201d; I asked. It was a stupid question and Leslie&#x2019;s dad didn&#x2019;t embarrass either of us by trying to answer it. I heard someone coming down the stairs and braced myself.<br><br>There&#x2019;d been severe damage to the maxilla, nasal spine, ramus, and mandible, Dr. Walid had said. And although much of the underlying muscle and tendons had survived, the surgeons at UCH had been unable to save much of the skin surface. They&#x2019;d put in a temporary scaffold to allow her to breathe and ingest food, and there was a chance that she might benefit from a partial face transplant&#x2014;if they could find a suitable donor. Given that what was left of her jaw was currently held together by a filigree of hypoallergenic metal, talking was out of the question. Dr. Walid had said that once the bones were sufficiently fused, they might be able to restore enough functionality to the jaw to allow for speech. But it all sounded a bit conditional to me. Whatever you see, he&#x2019;d said, take as long a look as you need to get used to it, to accept it, and then move on as if nothing has changed.<br><br>&#x201c;Here she is,&#x201d; said Leslie&#x2019;s dad and turned sideways to allow a slim figure to squeeze past him. She wore a blue-and-white-striped hoodie with the hood up, drawstring pulled tight so that it hid her forehead and chin. The lower face was covered by a matching blue-and-white-patterned scarf and her eyes by a pair of unfashionably large sunglasses I suspected had been looted from her mum&#x2019;s forgotten-clothes drawer. I stared but there was nothing to see.<br><br>&#x201c;You should have said we were going out robbing,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d have brought a balaclava.&#x201d;<br><br>She gave me a disgusted look&#x2014;I recognized it from the tilt of her head and the way she held her shoulders. I felt a stutter in my chest and took a deep breath.<br><br>&#x201c;Fancy a walk then?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>She nodded to her dad, took me firmly by the arm, and led me away from the house.<br><br>I felt her dad&#x2019;s eyes on my back as we walked off.<br><br>If you don&#x2019;t count the boatbuilding and the light engineering, Brightlingsea is not a noisy town even in the summer. Now, two weeks after the end of the school holidays, it was almost silent, just the occasional car and the sound of the gulls. I stayed quiet until we&#x2019;d crossed the high street where Leslie pulled her police-issue notebook out of her bag, flipped it open to the last page, and showed it to me.<br><br>What have you been up to? was written in black Biro across the page.<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want to know,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>She made it clear through hand gestures that yeah, she did want to know.<br><br>So I told her about the guy that had had his dick bitten off by a woman with teeth in her vagina, which seemed to amuse Leslie, and about the rumors that DCI Seawoll was being investigated by the IPCC about his conduct during the Covent Garden riots, which did not. I also didn&#x2019;t tell her that Terrence Pottsley, the only other victim to survive the magic that had damaged Leslie&#x2019;s face, had topped himself as soon as his family&#x2019;s backs were turned.<br><br>We didn&#x2019;t go straight to the shore. Instead Leslie led me the back way down Oyster Tank Road and through a grassy car park where rows of dinghies were parked on their trailers. A brisk wind from the sea moaned through the rigging and clonked the metal fittings together like cowbells. Hand in hand, we picked our way through the boats and out onto the windswept concrete esplanade. On one side cement steps led down to a beach carved into narrow strips by rotting breakwaters; on the other stood a line of brightly colored huts. Most were closed up tight but I did see one family determined to stretch the summer as far as it would go, the parents drinking tea in the shelter of their doorway while the kids kicked a soccer ball on the beach.<br><br>Between the end of the beach huts and the open-air swimming pool was a strip of grass and a shelter where we finally got to sit down. Constructed in the 1930s when people had realistic expectations of the British climate, it was brick-built and solid enough to serve as a tank trap. We sat down out of the wind on the bench that ran along the back of the alcove. The inside had been decorated with a mural of the seafront, blue sky, white clouds, red sails. Some total wanker had graffitied bmx across the sky and there was a list of names crudely painted down the side wall&#x2014;brooke t., emily b. and leslie m. They were just in the right location to have been painted by a bored teenager slumped on the corner of the bench. You didn&#x2019;t need to be a copper to see that this was where the yoofs of Brightlingsea came to hang out in that difficult gap between the age of criminal responsibility and that of legal drinking.<br><br>Leslie pulled an iPad clone out of her bag and fired it up. She typed in keyboard mode and the iPad spoke&#x2014;somebody in her family must have installed a speech synthesizer. It was a basic model with an American accent that made Leslie sound like an autistic surfer dude, but at least we could have an almost normal conversation.<br><br>She didn&#x2019;t bother with small talk.<br><br>&#x201c;Can magic fix?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I thought Dr. Walid had talked to you about that.&#x201d; I&#x2019;d been dreading this question.<br><br>&#x201c;Want you say,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>Leslie leaned over her pad and stabbed deliberately at the screen with her finger. She typed several separate lines before hitting return.<br><br>&#x201c;I want to hear it from you,&#x201d; said the iPad.<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because I trust you.&#x201d;<br><br>I took a breath. A pair of old-age pensioners raced past the shelter on mobility scooters.<br><br>&#x201c;As far as I can tell magic works within the same framework of physical laws as everything else,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;What magic do,&#x201d; said the iPad, &#x201c;magic can undo.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If you burn your hand on fire or electricity it&#x2019;s still a burn&#x2014;you fix it with bandages and cream and stuff like that. You don&#x2019;t use more electricity or more fire. You . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Had the skin and muscles of your face been pulled out of shape by a fucking malevolent spirit&#x2014;your jaw was all smashed up and the whole thing was held together with magic and when that ran out your face fell off. Your beautiful face. I was there, I watched it happen. And there was nothing I could do.<br><br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t just wish it away,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Know everything?&#x201d; asked the iPad.<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And I don&#x2019;t think Nightingale does either.&#x201d;<br><br>She sat silent and unmoving for a long while. I wanted to put my arm around her but I didn&#x2019;t know how she&#x2019;d react. I was just about to reach out when she nodded to herself and picked up the iPad again.<br><br>&#x201c;Show me,&#x201d; said the iPad.<br><br>&#x201c;Leslie . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Show me.&#x201d; She hit the repeat button several times. &#x201c;Show me, show me, show me . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; I said and reached for her iPad, but she pulled it out of my reach.<br><br>&#x201c;I have to take the battery out,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Or the magic will blow the chips.&#x201d;<br><br>Leslie flipped the iPad, cracked it open, and pulled the battery. After going through five phones in a row I&#x2019;d retrofitted my latest Samsung with a hardware cutoff that kept it safe but meant that the case was held together with elastic bands. Leslie shuddered when she saw it and made a snorting sound that I suspected was laughter.<br><br>I made the shape of the appropriate forma in my mind, opened my hand, and brought forth a werelight. Not a big one but enough to cast a pale light that was reflected in Leslie&#x2019;s sunglasses. She stopped laughing. I closed my hand and the light went out.<br><br>Leslie stared at my hand for a moment and then made the same gesture, repeating it twice, slowly and methodically. When nothing happened she looked up at me and I knew, underneath the glasses and scarf, that she was frowning.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that easy,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I practiced every morning for four hours for a month and a half before I could do that and that&#x2019;s just the first thing you have to learn. Have I told you about the Latin, the Greek . . . ?&#x201d;<br><br>We sat in silence for a moment, then she poked me in the arm. I sighed and produced another werelight. I could practically do it in my sleep by then. She copied the gesture and got nothing. I&#x2019;m not joking about how long it takes to learn.<br><br>The OAPs returned, drag racing past on the esplanade. I put the light out but Leslie carried on making the gesture, the movements becoming more impatient with every try. I stood it as long as I could before I took her hand in mine and made her stop.<br><br>We walked back to her house soon afterward. When we reached her porch she patted me on the arm, stepped inside, and shut the door in my face. Through the stained glass I watched her blurry shape retreat quickly down the hallway. Then she was gone.</p><h2>New American Standard Ultrathin Reference Bible; Burgundy Genuine Leather</h2><p>The NASB is a smooth reading literal English Bible translation, which provides increased clarity and readability for greater understanding while maintaining superior accuracy to the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts.

She was the recipient of fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Illinois Arts Council, and winner of the Carl Sandburg Award; she also received four Pushcart Prizes, the Juniper Prize and the Edwin Piper Memorial Prize. She died in 1994."Here in the late 20th century, with the young writing their professional poetry, it is both wonderful and bewildering to find these brilliant last poems of Lynda Hull. Hers is the amateur heart at play in the winter censuswhat wheeling incandescent numbers, in vision, were given before she was taken away...I'm confident that the best of her lyrics will survive us all." -- <i>Norman Dubie</i><br><br><p>"<i>The Only World</i> is a tableau of a witness's interior-exterior journey. Measured experience informs these poems, as Lynda Hull's voice comes alive again and again, line to line and image to image, propelling us outwards with her symphonic quest. With her adept flourishes, we can feel some nerve endings exposed; but there are also numerous moments of near beatitude. Because Hull has troubles the waters, her poetry makes us trurer to ourselves and those around us. Each image is a beam in a persistent searchlight that penetrates. We will miss her greatly. But we've been left this fine collection of poetry, a gift we can hold in our hands." -- <i>Yusef Komunyakaa</i><br><br></p><p>"Of all the poets of my generation, Lynda Hull remains the most heartbreaking, merciful, and consoling. If Eurydice had simply refused to follow Orpheus up into the soft prison of sunlight, instead turning back to her beloved underworld, these poems are the songs she would have sung in celebration of all of us who struggle, fail, and yet somehow survive. <i>The Only World</i> is now what is left to us of Lynda Hull's extraordinary lyric grace and constant poetic courage. It is a book to treasure." -- <i>David St. John</i></p></p><h2>Trench Art</h2><p>Engraved shell-cases, bullet-crucifixes, letter openers and cigarette lighters made of shrapnel and cartridges, miniature airplanes and tanks, talismanic jewelry, embroidery, objects carved from stone, bone and wood &#x2013; all of these things are trench art, the misleading name given to the dazzling array of objects made from the waste of war, in particular the Great War of 1914-1918 and the inter-war years. And they are the subject of Nicholas Saunders&#x2019;s pioneering study which is now republished in a revised edition in paperback.<br><br>He reveals the lost world of trench art, for every piece relates to the story of the momentous experience of its maker &#x2013; whether front-line soldier, prisoner of war, or civilian refugee. The objects resonate with the alternating terror and boredom of war, and those created by the prisoners symbolize their struggle for survival in the camps. Many of these items were poignant souvenirs bought by battlefield pilgrims between 1919 and 1939 and kept brightly polished on mantelpieces, often for a lifetime.<br><br>Nicholas Saunders investigates their origins and how they were made, exploring their personal meaning and cultural significance. He also offers an important categorization of types which will be a useful guide for collectors.</p><p>Nicholas J. Saunders was educated at the universities of Sheffield, Cambridge, and Southampton. He has held teaching and research positions at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, the University of the West Indies, Dumbarton Oaks, Washington D.C., and at University College London, where he was Reader in Material Culture and undertook a major British Academy sponsored investigation into the material culture anthropology of the First World War. As of 2014 Saunders is Professor in the Department of Archaeology and Anthropology at the University of Bristol,This is not a catalogue of the different types of 'Trench Art' available to the collector. Nicholas Saunders has taken a more academic approach to the subject, looking into the reasons for the 'Trench Art' in the first place, as well as suggesting methods of classification rather than just by type of item. Covering methods, location and era of manufacture this is a book not only for the 'Trench Art' collector and 'militaria' buff, but also for anyone with an interest in the social history of the period 1914-1939. Written in an easy style, with many superb photos this book is sure to become a definitive work on the subject. --By Nicholas J. Ofield<br><br>In this book Nicholas Saunders has answered most, if not all, of my questions on this subject. He has exhaustively researched this much ignored field of militaria and the book includes some astounding photographic records of trench art being crafted 'in the field' and even contemporary adverts for having your 'souvenirs of the war' professionally mounted etc ! This is the first book exclusively on the subject, and for such excellent pioneering work, Mr Saunders must be applauded - this book can only help to promote the subject to new collectors and will provide an invaluable boost in knowledge to all but the most experienced trench art collectors. While this book stops short of offering anything but the broadest values for categories of trench art, as a reference it is worth it's weight in gold. If you collect trench art, or are simply interested in the First World War, this book is a must - buy it !! --By Mr J Gordon-Cumming<br><br>Over the last decade or so Dr Saunders has not only focused on an area which had hitherto been largely neglected, but has made the subject of trench art very much his own. This little book is particularly nice being an especially good and colourful example in the Shire series. The photos are good quality, clear, relevant, and well selected. This book is positioned ideally for the likely market and is well written and informative - I read it in a single sitting and came away much enlightened even though I had already been interested in trench art for quite some time. This soft back is 48 pages with the better part of 100 illustrations. Any problems ? Not really but a couple of minor corrections might be suggested. For example (P 14) the making of shell case trench art was not always illegal, many shell cases were sold out of service and marked accordingly. These then became the property of whoever had purchased them and the new owner could then make whatever he wanted with them. A couple of shell heads (pp 20-21) are described as 'shell cases'. --By Stephen Bull</p><h2>Jungle Bugs: Masters of Camouflage and Mimicry</h2><p><p> During roughly 400 million years on this planet, one million species of insects have developed with a great diversity of shape and color to protect them from predators. </p><p> Bruce Purser spent years traveling through tropical forests studying insects and photographing their ongoing quest for survival as they blended into tree trunks and imitated sticks, leaves, other bugs, and even bird droppings. Taken in exotic locales including French Guyana, the Peruvian Amazon, Malaysia, Kenya, Morocco, and Venezuela, his dazzling photographs are accompanied by thoughtful text as he traces the insects' efforts to hide from or scare off their predators. </p><p> In this charming and informative book:</p><ul> <li></li>Explore the dangerous and little-known world of insects <li></li>Experience exotic tropic tours <li></li>Discover animal behavior in lively and understandable language <li></li>Find out how a good disguise or a good impersonation can make the difference between life and death in the animal world </ul><p></p><p> Stunning color photographs reveal insect secrets that we would never get a chance to observe ourselves: such as a harmless moth that looks exactly like a stinging wasp or an inoffensive butterfly that's protected from predators because its coloring is almost identical to that of a highly poisonous variety. </p></p><p><p> <b>Bruce Purser</b> spent the first ten years of his life on a sheep farm in New Zealand where he developed his lifelong fascination with insects. He trained as a geologist, which led him to the jungles of Borneo and Sumatra. He visited many tropical forests, notably those of South America. In the 1970s he moved from collecting insects to photographing them. </p>Insects have lived on our planet for about 450 million years and are found in every one of the habitats that have appeared over that long period. The roughly 1 million species of insects all have predators, and during their long tenure, they have evolved many subtle ways to escape being eaten. Camouflage--the ability to hide in plain sight--and mimicry--the ability to mimic other dangerous or unpalatable animals--are two strategies very well developed in the insect world. Purser has been photographing insects in jungle areas all over the world since the 1970s, and this collection of his images reveals the amazing ways insects hide from their predators. From moths and katydids that resemble leaves to butterfly chrysalids that dangle like crumpled foliage, the camouflage exhibited by tropical insects is truly amazing. Even more astonishing are the mimics: palatable butterflies that have copied the wing patterns of poisonous species and butterflies with false heads on their wings. In common with other Firefly productions, this book is beautifully illustrated with the author's photos. <i>Nancy Bent</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Like in <i>The Terminator</i>, the bad guys in <i>The Devil's Teardrop</i> just won't quit, and they create enough havoc in the last 50 pages to fill a whole new book.<p> Although Deaver's brilliant, wheelchair-bound forensic expert Lincoln Rhyme makes a guest appearance, the muscular scientist in charge here is Parker Kincaid--an expert in document analysis who'd much rather be checking the authenticity of letters from Thomas Jefferson than figuring out when a crazed shooter known as the Digger will strike again. But it's New Year's Eve, 1999, and the Digger has begun a reign of terror--promising to shoot into crowds in Washington, D.C., every four hours until he's paid $20 million. As Kincaid searches an odd ransom note for clues (and tries to maintain a low profile so that his vindictive ex-wife won't get custody of his young kids), we get to know the Digger better. He is a frighteningly invisible character with serious brain damage, who methodically obeys a set of instructions from an unknown handler. We also learn many amazing facts about paper, ink, and handwriting analysis, and watch as a relationship slowly and reluctantly develops between Kincaid and the FBI agent in charge. All this as the devious Deaver leads us down several garden paths overflowing with dead bodies. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p><b>Jeffery Deaver</b> is the author of fourteen suspense novels.

In the past scholars have explained this proliferation of readily identifiable amulets by a sudden need for magic or by a precipitous rise in superstition or anxiety in this period, connected, perhaps, with the internal breakdown of Greek rationalism or the migration of superstitious peoples from the East.</p><p>Christopher A. Faraone argues, instead, that these amulets were not invented in this period as a result of an alteration in the Roman worldview or a tidal wave of "oriental" influence, but rather that they only become visible to us in the archaeological record as a result of a number of technical innovations and transformations: the increased epigraphic habit of the Imperial period, the miniaturization of traditional domestic amulets, like the triple-faced Hecate, on durable gems, or the utilization of newly crafted Egyptianizing iconography. In short, it is only when explicitly protective or curative texts, or strange new images, are added to traditional Greek amulets, that modern observers realize that these objects were thought to have the power to protect or heal all along. The real question addressed by the book, then, is not why we can identify so many amulets in the Roman Imperial period but, rather, why we have failed to identify them in artifacts of the preceding centuries.</p><p>Featuring more than 120 illustrations, <i>The Transformation of Greek Amulets in Roman Imperial Times</i> is not only a tremendous resource for those working in the fields of ancient magic and religion but also an essential reference for those interested in the religion, culture, and history of the ancient Mediterranean.</p></p><p>Christopher A. Faraone is the Frank Curtis Springer and Gertrude Melcher Springer Professor in the Humanities and Professor in the Department of Classics at the University of Chicago. He is author of Vanishing Acts: Deletio Morbi as Speech Act and Visual Design on Ancient Greek Amulets and The Stanzaic Architecture of Archaic Greek Elegy.<p>Preface</p><p>This study has a precursor of sorts, a book written more than a quarter century ago about talismanic and apotropaic statues in ancient Greece and devoted mainly to the protective role of such images in the ancient Greek city. That book was well received, but some reviewers were surprised that it did not contain a single illustration. And indeed, I must admit that at that time, because of my training and orientation as a philologist, I was focused almost exclusively on literary, rather than archaeological, evidence and that it did not occur to me to include any photographs or drawings. This volume, as the gentle reader will discover, has more than a hundred illustrations, a change that reflects both a great benefit and a great risk. Beneficial, I hope, is the way it brings together for the first time a wide array of art-historical, archaeological, papyrological, epigraphical, and literary sources to bear on the subject of ancient Greek amulets; risky, because each of these scholarly traditions and each of the many subfields within them involve a bibliography and an expertise that is beyond the human powers of a single scholar. There will, I am sure, be some details missed or evidence wrongly assessed, but my hope is that the experts, many of whom I thank below for their help, will overlook such lapses and errors and enjoy the wider and, I hope, richer panorama sketched in these pages. This book has three thematic sections&#x2014;"Archaeology," "Images," and "Texts"&#x2014;that could perhaps be read in isolation, the first by archaeologists, the second by art historians, and the third by philologists, but I would strongly advise against proceeding in this manner, because such an approach would simply reify these traditional academic boundaries and undermine or at least ignore the central argument of this study that the popularity of easily identifiable amulets in the Roman period reflects a long process of accretion, whereby the traditional shapes and media surveyed in the first section begin in the imperial period to take on images and texts that tell us unequivocally and for the first time that these shapes and media were being used all along as amulets.</p><p><br>This volume began to take shape in Paris, when in the autumn of 2011 at the invitation of John Scheid, I gave four lectures at the Coll�ge de France, each of which eventually became important parts of Chapters 1, 2, 4, and 8. I cannot thank John enough for the invitation, which helped focus what was at the time a somewhat inchoate project, and I thank the audience for their questions and especially for their skepticism about some of the arguments that I eventually overhauled or abandoned. Roughly two years later I returned to Paris to take up a fellowship at the Institut d'�tudes Avanc�es de Paris, where, thanks to the collegial atmosphere created by Gretty Mirdal and Simon Luck, I finished a full draft of all of the internal chapters. Gratitude is also due to the University of Chicago's Paris Centre, especially to Robert Morrissey and Sebastien Greppo, for various kinds of additional support that made my year in Paris especially productive, and to Fran�ois Lissarrague, who kindly lent me his desk, computer, and scanner at the Gernet-Glotz Library. But I was, in fact, working on individual sections of this book as early as the autumn of 2008, when, as a fellow at the Institute of Advanced Studies at Princeton, I wrote a long article on metrical incantations inscribed onto amulets that eventually became a large part of Chapter 8. I am grateful to Heinrich Von Staden for conversation and encouragement during my time at the Institute, as well as to the other fellows and especially to the librarians for their help. In the winter of 2009, as a research fellow at the Getty Villa Museum in Malibu and with the guidance of Ken Lapatin and Fran�ois Lissarrague, I began to make some first tentative steps toward thinking about the images on ancient Greek amulets and how one might go about interpreting them. It was there that I first presented the material that now makes up the second half of Chapter 4.</p><p>Throughout the past eight years, I have been happily associated with the Campbell Bonner Magical Gems Database, which continues to flourish at the Mus�e des Beaux Arts in Budapest under the wisdom and energetic leadership of �rp�d Nagy, whose keen eye and friendship have also been crucial to the evolution of the volume at hand. Attilio Mastrocinque, another dear friend and associate of the Database, taught me how to photograph these magical gems during a marathon visit to the basement of the Kelsey Museum in Ann Arbor, Michigan. His exquisitely photographed and commentated corpora of the magical gems in the major Italian collections (2003 and 2008) and in the Cabinet des M�dailles in Paris (2014) were timely and crucial research tools for this volume. I cannot thank him and �rp�d enough, as both read and commented on the entire manuscript and saved me from numerous errors. Other associates in the group include Simone Michel-von Dungern, author of the marvelous 2001 edition of the magical gems in the British Museum and an indispensable 2004 study of all the extant gems; Erika Zwierlein-Diehl; Veronique Dasen; Jeffrey Spier; and Richard Gordon. To Richard I owe additional thanks for his numerous and penetrating studies on ancient magic and even more so for his skepticism and goodwill in commenting on my work either from the audience or on the margins of the page.</p><p>Over the past eight years, I have also visited a number of museums and libraries to photograph and study their magical gems, papyri, and other amulets, both for my own continuing education and for my contributions to the Campbell Bonner Database. At nearly every stop I encountered extremely dedicated and helpful individuals. Early on, Matilde Avisseau-Broustet (Cabinet des M�dailles), Yekaterina Barbash (Brooklyn Museum), Chris Entwistle (British Museum), Ken Lapatin (Getty Villa Museum), Andrew Meadows (American Numismatic Society), and Brian Rose (University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology) were exceedingly helpful and allowed extended or repeated visits.

Wilcox (Museum of Art and Archaeology, University of Missouri), and Terry Wilfong (Kelsey Museum of Archaeology, University of Michigan-Ann Arbor).</p><p>Finally, as my research for this volume often required me to venture into areas of study beyond my expertise, I am especially grateful to the following individuals for answering questions, suggesting bibliography, reading parts of the manuscript, or sending me their work in progress: Yekaterina Barbash, Caitlin Barret, Jacco Dieleman, Ian S. Moyer, Joachim Friedrich Quack, Robert Ritner, and Emily Teeter for guidance with the Egyptian material; Walter Farber and Joann Scurlock for the Mesopotamian; Brien Garnand, Carolina Lopez-Ruiz, and Phil Schmitz for the Phoenician and Carthaginian; Bruce Lincoln for the Persian; Gideon Bohak and Ortal-Paz Saar for the Jewish; Cliff Ando for the Roman; Veronique Dasen, Patricia Gaillard-Seux, and Paul Keyser for the medical; Tom Carpenter, Jas Elsner, Emanuel Meyer, Sarah Morris, Marina Piranomonte, Verity Platt, James Redfield, Joe Rife, Richard Veymiers, Paolo Vitellozzi, and Anastasia Zografou for the archaeological and art historical; Marianna D�gi, Robert Daniel, Todd Hickey, Raquel Martin Hernandez, Roberta Mazza, Dirk Obbink, and Sofia Toralles Tovar for the papyrological; and Alexander Hollmann and Roy Kotansky for the epigraphical. For those who I have unwittingly left off this long list, I offer my deepest apologies. I should close this list of acknowledgments by thanking again Roy Kotansky, who is in fact the amulet expert that I have known longest and with whom I cowrote an article nearly thirty years ago about a gold-foil amulet in Connecticut: Roy, in addition to his friendship and his magisterial <i>Greek Magical Amulets</i>, which has been at my side throughout this project, has generously shared his notes, drawings, and insights; answered what must have seemed an unending series of email questions; and read and commented on the entire manuscript.</p><p>In addition to the residential fellowships mentioned above, I am also deeply grateful for grants from the Loeb Foundation and the University of Chicago's Women's Board. Also in Chicago and for various kinds of editorial or technical help I am very thankful to Jeremy Brightbill, Kassandra Jackson, Thomas Keith, Megan Nutzman, and Walter Shandruk and for bibliographic genius to Cathy Mardikes at the Regenstein Library. Most especially, I thank my friend and former dean, Martha Roth, for her continual support of this project, both financial and otherwise. Finally, this work has derived continual energy, inspiration, and goodwill from my friends, coteachers, and coconspirators at the Center for the Study of Ancient Religions at the University of Chicago: Clifford Ando and Bruce Lincoln. I consider myself extremely lucky to have spent the past twenty-five years in such a rich and dynamic intellectual environment.</p><p><br>Preliminary arguments for this volume appeared earlier as articles in <i>Classical Antiquity</i>; <i>Classical Philology</i>, <i>Greek, Roman and Byzantine Studies</i>, <i>Kernos</i>, <i>Journal of Roman Studies</i>; <i>MHNH: Revista internacional de investigaci�n sobre magia y astrolog�a antiguas</i>; <i>Museum Helveticum</i>, <i>Zeitschrift f�r Papyrologie und Epigraphik</i>, and a number of edited volumes.</p><p>I have tried to make the book more user-friendly for nonspecialists by leaving out the original Greek texts and citing in transliteration, only when absolutely necessary, individual Greek words or phrases. I have, however, treated many of these texts in detail in previous publications, to which I direct the reader in the notes. In transliterating Greek names, it has seemed reasonable, if not entirely consistent, to use the familiar Latinized spelling for well-known names for which this has become normal English usage (e.g., Socrates or Theophrastus) and in other cases to transliterate directly from the Greek (e.g., Dike or Ladike). In my translations of Greek and Latin texts, I use a very simplified system of brackets: square brackets [ ] indicate a lacuna in the ancient text that has been filled in by modern editors who extrapolate the missing word or words from the surrounding text, while parentheses ( ) are used to supplement the text by providing extra words or phrases or, more rarely, giving in transliteration the original Greek word or words, with the goal of making a difficult passage less opaque. A glossary of perhaps unfamiliar authors and texts appears at the end of the volume, followed by another of perhaps unfamiliar technical terms. The nine appendices summarize a variety of ancient formularies or handbooks that preserve recipes for protective and curative incantations or amulets.</p></p><h2>Black, Pregnant and Loving It: The Comprehensive Pregnancy Guide for Today&#x2019;s Woman of Color</h2><p><p><b>The Only Month-By-Month Pregnancy Guide for Black Women </b></p><p>Let&#x2019;s face it: Not all pregnancies are created equal.

But the biggest threat comes from her own past...</p><p>A debut author at the age of nineteen, <b>Thea Harrison</b> had sixteen romances published under another name before she took a break to collect a couple of graduate degrees and a grown child. She&#x2019;s back with the Novels of the Elder Races, a paranormal romance series. Thea lives in California with her family.<p>ONE</p><p><i>Vampyre&#x2019;s Ball, New Year&#x2019;s Eve</i></p><p>Cautiously, Tess peered at the crowd through a side stage door. She might be able to control her behavior, but her body told a different story. Her mouth had dried out, her heart pounded and her palms had turned clammy.</p><p>All the monsters were beautiful. Vampyres loved beauty, and they were some of the most celebrated in all of the Elder Races.</p><p>Charismatic and elegantly dressed in black tie and couture gowns, Vampyres filled the banquet-style great hall. Some sat at large round tables in the middle of the floor, but many stood and mingled. Human attendants wove through the clusters of glittering creatures, doing the bidding of their patrons.</p><p>Most of the attendants were dressed in subdued, discreet clothing, but there were a few standouts, such as the dark haired woman wearing a diamond collar that flashed with brilliant fire. Barefoot, she wore a silk, champagne-colored sheath dress. The paper-thin material of the dress was short, barely covering the woman&#x2019;s ass. Sapphires studded her leash, the end of which hung negligently on the slim wrist of her Vampyre patroness.</p><p>The redheaded Vampyre wore a black velvet evening gown and a haughty expression. She never glanced at her collared attendant, who shifted and turned to keep flawless pace with her patroness, rather like a well-trained dog. As the pair faced Tess, she saw that the collared woman wore a small, private smile. She didn&#x2019;t look abused, and her creamy skin appeared flawless. If anything, she looked like she enjoyed being on display.</p><p>To the sides of the great hall and up on a mezzanine level were more private areas where the most powerful of the elite could lounge in comfort. Any Vampyre who was anybody of note in the Nightkind demesne attended the annual Vampyre&#x2019;s Ball, even the Nightkind King himself, Julian Regillus.</p><p>Tess checked the number on her ticket. When she had joined the candidates, the line had gone out the back of the building and down the alley, but she&#x2019;d finally made it inside. Now there were only three people ahead of her.</p><p>A new candidate took the stage. She had a California-girl style of beauty, tall and leggy with long, blonde tresses&#x2014;yes, tresses&#x2014;that had been styled to fall in thick waves around her perfect heart-shaped face and slender shoulders. Green eyes sparkled with a coquettish vivacity as she slipped off a short, red dressing gown. Totally naked, she spun in a circle on five-inch, nude-colored stiletto heels. Taking the microphone from the human, middle-aged emcee, she began a catwalk strut across the stage while she talked.</p><p>&#x201c;Hi everybody, I hope you&#x2019;re all having a wonderful evening! My name is Haley, and I&#x2019;m so excited to be here with you tonight! I&#x2019;m twenty-one years old, and I&#x2019;m working on my bachelor&#x2019;s in sociology at Berkeley.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>This was like an X-rated version of <i>America&#x2019;s Got Talent</i>, except with Vampyres.</p><p>A tension headache began to throb behind Tess&#x2019;s right eye. She hadn&#x2019;t thought she was a prude, but the other woman had just disrobed as casually as if she were about to step into a bathtub in her own home. Haley was the same smooth honey tan all over. Nothing jiggled or dimpled anywhere. Her breasts looked like perfect, gravity-defying circles glued to her slender torso.</p><p>Now, those couldn&#x2019;t be natural.</p><p>Tess glanced down at herself. Not that she was going to strip down for anybody when it was her turn to take the stage, but even with her clothes on, it was perfectly clear that everything about her was horrendously average.</p><p>The best thing anybody could say about her body was that she was fit, and even then, she did jiggle in a few places. Her straight, dark hair was cut into a sensible bob, but she was two weeks overdue for a trim. She wore faded jeans, black shoes with flat heels and a black sweater, mainly because it was the only outfit she had left with her that was still clean.</p><p>The Vampyres continued with their conversations. Not a single one in the crowded hall looked at Haley. No one lifted a bidding paddle.</p><p>Tess turned her attention to the mezzanine level. She could just see the Nightkind King&#x2019;s strong, rough profile as he talked with the monster sitting opposite him. The Vampyre with him appeared to be a young man, with nut brown hair pulled back in a simple ponytail and a pleasantly nondescript, mild-mannered face.</p><p>His appearance couldn&#x2019;t be more of a lie. Xavier del Torro was one of the most notorious of all the Vampyres, a feared hunter famous in all of the Elder Races&#x2014;and famous among humans as well&#x2014;and Julian&#x2019;s right-hand man. Neither del Torro nor the King glanced at the stage.</p><p>Haley worked hard for her allotted two minutes. Her routine was polished, professional and raunchy, and it left the onlookers in no doubt. Clearly she was ready and willing to do anything to become a Vampyre&#x2019;s attendant. When the buzzer sounded, she swept up her discarded robe and exited stage left with a bright smile and a cheerful, Miss Universe pageant-style wave.</p><p>The next candidate walked onto the stage with quick, jerky movements. This one was a man in his forties dressed in a department store suit. He looked tense and so uncomfortable, Tess&#x2019;s muscles clenched with empathy. She could relate.</p><p>When the emcee handed the candidate the microphone, he cleared his throat, pulled out a photo and held it in the air. It wavered visibly in his unsteady hand. In the photo, a girl grinned at the camera, her head tilted to one side.</p><p>&#x201c;My name is Roberto Sanchez, and I am here on behalf of my beautiful daughter Cara. Cara is fourteen years old, and she is in the hospital. She has childhood leukemia. She was in remission for three years, but now the cancer has returned. Please, I am begging you&#x2014;someone have mercy on her. If you would only agree to be her patron, you could help to heal her. She&#x2019;s a good girl. She can work hard for you, if only she felt better.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Tess winced. Sanchez was breaking several of the rules that had been handed out on cards to those candidates who had been lucky enough to get a ticket and now stood in line, waiting for their turn on the stage. All medically based petitions must go through the visa application process at the Bureau of Nightkind Immigration.</p><p>The annual Vampyre&#x2019;s Ball on New Year&#x2019;s Eve was an occasion to make a different kind of petition altogether, a kind of massive job screening process where Vampyres of standing might choose to take on human attendants to add to their households.</p><p>Supposedly the relationship between a Vampyre patron and his human attendants was a mutually beneficial arrangement. The attendants assured the Vampyre a steady blood supply in addition to working to support the household as a whole. In return the Vampyre offered his protection and assured that the attendant would have a safe, secure place in which to live, and a long, healthy life. There was even an outside chance that a candidate might become a Vampyre himself one day.</p><p>Both opportunities were rare. According to the website FAQs that Tess had read, the Nightkind demesne in the United States received over ten million visa applications a year from humans hoping to be turned, while the number of newly created Vampyres each year was the tiniest fraction of that and strictly controlled by the Nightkind demesne working in coordination with the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia.</p><p>Probably Sanchez had already applied for a visa for his daughter and had been turned down. Clearly desperation had pushed him onto the stage.</p><p>Just as it would push Tess, when it was her turn.</p><p>The next few moments were excruciating, and not just because of the rawness of Sanchez&#x2019;s pleading, although that was bad enough.</p><p>The worst was that the Vampyres did nothing.</p><p><i>Nothing.</i></p><p>Nobody moved to interrupt Sanchez. The emcee did not order security to remove him. Nobody turned to look at the pleading man or raised a bidding paddle. They all acted as if he did not exist.</p><p>A sickened anger tied her stomach in knots. This was horrendous, degrading, and it didn&#x2019;t matter that cold logic said there could be no good way to handle candidates like Sanchez, or that his petition had been doomed from the start. The number of visa applicants was overwhelming to begin with. If the Vampyres gave into one Sanchez who broke the rules, they would never be able to stop the flood of others.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t know what was worse&#x2014;their show of indifference or the humans who chose to abase themselves onstage.</p><p>And I&#x2019;m one of them, she thought. She wiped her face with a shaking hand. How in God&#x2019;s name could I have ever thought this might be a good idea?</p><p>Scratch that, I never thought it was a good idea. It was my only idea.</p><p>The reason was simple. When you pissed off the devil, you ran out of options real fast.</p><p>The buzzer sounded. With agonizing politeness, the emcee escorted Sanchez off the stage, and the next candidate came on.</p><p>The person behind Tess elbowed her with a hiss, and she eased the stage door closed to step into the wings. Her blood pounded in her ears, and her shaking breath caught in her throat. This was far worse than any kind of normal stage fright, magnified as it was by anger, revulsion and fear.</p><p>As if from a long distance away, she heard the buzzer sound. And again.</p><p>When it was her turn, she stepped forward and waited just behind the curtain for her cue. If she held herself any more rigidly, she felt like she might break into pieces.</p><p>The emcee walked toward her with a practiced smile and a sharp, disinterested gaze. Holding out a hand, he beckoned to her. She walked forward into a flood of hot lights, stopped at the X taped on the floor and faced the crowded hall. Her cold fingers curled automatically around the microphone when it was shoved into her hand.</p><p>The lights on the stage had turned the Vampyres into shadowy figures that made them seem even more menacing. She wanted to scream at them, or laugh at the absurdity of the whole scenario.</p><p>Instead, the intolerable tension fractured and she iced over with a clear, clean anger. None of them would listen to anything she might say anyway.</p><p>Not bothering to raise the microphone, she said in a calm, flat voice, &#x201c;My looks are entirely forgettable, and I&#x2019;m smarter than almost anyone here.&#x201d;</p><p>Screw them, if they weren&#x2019;t able to see what advantages there could be in any of that. Screw all of them.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>On the mezzanine floor, one of the Vampyres turned from his conversation to look down at her.</p><p>He raised his paddle.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>Blinded by the bright lights shining in her face, Tess couldn&#x2019;t see if her words had caused any reaction. She only knew she wasn&#x2019;t going to stay on the stage for one more moment. She had to go somewhere quiet to try to figure out her next move. Pivoting, she strode to the emcee &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the exit?&#x201d;</p><p>Giving her a strange look, he walked with her to the opposite edge of the stage, where another young woman in an aide&#x2019;s uniform waited in the wings. Plucking the microphone out of Tess&#x2019;s hand, the emcee moved on to the next candidate.</p><p>Despair weighed down her limbs until she felt as if she were moving through water. She asked the aide tightly, &#x201c;How do I get out of here?&#x201d;</p><p>Like the emcee, all of the servers and aides at the Ball were human. The woman gave her the same strange look as the emcee had, incredulity mingled with envy, and darkened with the faintest tinge of resentment. &#x201c;I know candidates can&#x2019;t see it when they&#x2019;re on the stage, but you&#x2019;ve been selected for an interview.&#x201d;</p><p>Tess blinked. She couldn&#x2019;t have heard that right. The words didn&#x2019;t make any sense. &#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Someone wants to interview you.&#x201d; The aide checked the screen of her iPad then rapidly input something with a stylus. &#x201c;Go down the hall to the back staircase, then up to the second floor. Remember, one flight up is the mezzanine level. The second floor is two flights up. Your interview will be in room 219. He&#x2019;ll be with you shortly.&#x201d;</p><p>He.</p><p>She was almost getting used to the slightly nauseous tension that clenched her stomach. &#x201c;Who is it?&#x201d;</p><p>Even as she asked, the aide turned away to beckon the next candidate offstage. As the woman stepped into the wings, she clutched at the aide&#x2019;s hands. &#x201c;This is my sixth year auditioning. How did I do? Did someone ask for me?&#x201d;</p><p>Tess turned away. The only way she would find out who wanted to talk to her was by going up to the room. Feeling dazed, she went down the utilitarian hall and walked up two flights of stairs.</p><p>The building was old. During the California gold rush, it had been one of San Francisco&#x2019;s premiere hotels, but it had been partially gutted and renovated in the 1920s to be used for the Vampyre&#x2019;s Ball.</p><p>Away from the glittering elegance of the main ballroom, the building showed its age. Still, the upstairs was a little better than the hallway backstage. There were a few touches of faded glory, in the scratched and peeling gilding on the stairway railings, in the worn carpet, and in the crown molding at the edges of the ceiling.</p><p>The upstairs rooms had once been hotel rooms. As the thought occurred to her, she clenched both hands into fists.</p><p>Relatively few Vampyres reached enough prominence to support a household of attendants, but when they did, they set their own rules for what happened in their domain. She had heard rumors that in some households, attendants provided more than just blood and assigned work. They also traded sexual favors in return for the kind of lifestyle that a wealthy Vampyre patron could offer.</p><p>Even if an attendant never gained the opportunity to be turned, regular bites from a patron boosted a human&#x2019;s natural immune system, and they could live as long as a hundred and thirty years. There were reasons why Haley had gone naked onto the stage, not least of which was the opportunity to live more than half again one&#x2019;s own natural life span and to die in one&#x2019;s sleep of old age.</p><p>Room 219 was tucked between others in the middle of the hall. As soon as she gripped the door handle, her muscles locked up and she stood frozen, unable to make herself step into the room and yet not able to walk away, while rapid-fire thoughts snapped at her heels like feral dogs.</p><p>This &#x201c;interview&#x201d; could be another version of the casting couch scenario.</p><p>If there&#x2019;s a bed in the room, that&#x2019;s it, she thought. I&#x2019;m out of here.</p><p>I think.</p></p><h2>You&#39;re Amazing, Anna Hibiscus!</h2><p>The final book in the award-winning Anna Hibiscus series depicts the sadness, loss and anger Anna feels at the death of a loved one - a beautiful way to share and talk about death with young children.</p><p></p><h2>Lord Of Chaos</h2><p>Lord of Chaos</p><p>On the slopes of Shayol Ghul, the Myrddraal swords are forged, and the sky is not the sky of this world; .

So begins Karen Armstrong?s concise yet compelling investigation into myth: how it has evolved and why it is so essential to our ability to live well. She takes us from the Paleolithic period and the earliest mythologies of the hunters up to the ?Great Western Transformation? of the last 500 years, including the recent discrediting of myth by science. The history of myth is the history of humanity. Our stories and beliefs, our curiosity, and attempts to understand the world link us not only to our ancestors but to each other. Today, more than ever, myths help us make sense of the universe and of ourselves, our longings and our weaknesses. Heralding a major series of retellings of the ancient myths by authors from around the world, Armstrong?s characteristically insightful book is an eloquent introduction to any understanding of myth ? and why, if we dismiss it in the modern age, we do so at our peril.</p><p>Since leaving her religious order in 1969, Karen Armstrong has become one of the world&#x2019;s foremost commentators on religion. Her bestselling books include her acclaimed memoirs <b>Through the Narrow Gate</b>, which describes her seven years as a young nun in a Catholic order, and <b>The Spiral Staircase</b>, as well as the internationally renowned <b>A History of God</b>, <b>Islam: A Short History</b>, <b>The Battle for God</b>, <b>Holy War</b> and <b>Buddha</b>. Karen Armstrong lives in London.What is a Myth?<br>Human beings have always been mythmakers. Archaeologists have unearthed Neanderthal graves containing weapons, tools and the bones of a sacrificed animal, all of which suggest some kind of belief in a future world that was similar to their own. The Neanderthals may have told each other stories about the life that their dead companion now enjoyed. They were certainly reflecting about death in a way that their fellow-creatures did not. Animals watch each other die but, as far as we know, they give the matter no further consideration. But the Neanderthal graves show that when these early people became conscious of their mortality, they created some sort of counter-narrative that enabled them to come to terms with it. The Neanderthals who buried their companions with such care seem to have imagined that the visible, material world was not the only reality. From a very early date, therefore, it appears that human beings were distinguished by their ability to have ideas that went beyond their everyday experience.<br><br>We are meaning-seeking creatures. Dogs, as far as we know, do not agonise about the canine condition, worry about the plight of dogs in other parts of the world, or try to see their lives from a different perspective. But human beings fall easily into despair, and from the very beginning we invented stories that enabled us to place our lives in a larger setting, that revealed an underlying pattern, and gave us a sense that, against all the depressing and chaotic evidence to the contrary, life had meaning and value.<br><br>Another peculiar characteristic of the human mind is its ability to have ideas and experiences that we cannot explain rationally. We have imagination, a faculty that enables us to think of something that is not immediately present, and that, when we first conceive it, has no objective existence. The imagin�ation is the faculty that produces religion and mythology. Today mythical thinking has fallen into disrepute; we often dismiss it as irrational and self-indulgent. But the imagination is also the faculty that has enabled scientists to bring new knowledge to light and to invent technology that has made us immeasurably more effective. The imagination of scientists has enabled us to travel through outer space and walk on the moon, feats that were once only possible in the realm of myth. Mythology and science both extend the scope of human beings. Like science and technology, mythology, as we shall see, is not about opting out of this world, but about enabling us to live more intensely within it.<br><br>The Neanderthal graves tell us five important things about myth. First, it is nearly always rooted in the experience of death and the fear of extinction. Second, the animal bones indicate that the burial was accompanied by a sacrifice. Mythology is usually inseparable from ritual. Many myths make no sense outside a liturgical drama that brings them to life, and are incomprehensible in a profane setting. Third, the Neanderthal myth was in some way recalled beside a grave, at the limit of human life. The most powerful myths are about extremity; they force us to go beyond our experience. There are moments when we all, in one way or another, have to go to a place that we have never seen, and do what we have never done before. Myth is about the unknown; it is about that for which initially we have no words. Myth therefore looks into the heart of a great silence. Fourth, myth is not a story told for its own sake. It shows us how we should behave. In the Neanderthal graves, the corpse has sometimes been placed in a foetal position, as though for rebirth: the deceased had to take the next step himself. Correctly understood, mythology puts us in the correct spiritual or psychological posture for right action, in this world or the next.<br><br>Finally, all mythology speaks of another plane that exists alongside our own world, and that in some sense supports it. Belief in this invisible but more powerful reality, sometimes called the world of the gods, is a basic theme of mythology. It has been called the &#x2018;perennial philosophy&#x2019; because it informed the mythology, ritual and social organisation of all societies before the advent of our scientific modernity, and continues to influence more traditional societies today. According to the perennial philosophy, everything that happens in this world, everything that we can hear and see here below has its counterpart in the divine realm, which is richer, stronger and more enduring than our own.1 And every earthly reality is only a pale shadow of its archetype, the original pattern, of which it is simply an imperfect copy. It is only by participating in this divine life that mortal, fragile human beings fulfil their potential. The myths gave explicit shape and form to a reality that people sensed intuitively. They told them how the gods behaved, not out of idle curiosity or because these tales were entertaining, but to enable men and women to imitate these powerful beings and experience divinity themselves.<br><br>In our scientific culture, we often have rather simplistic notions of the divine. In the ancient world, the &#x2018;gods&#x2019; were rarely regarded as supernatural beings with discrete personalities, living a totally separate metaphysical existence. Mythology was not about theology, in the modern sense, but about human experience. People thought that gods, humans, animals and nature were inextricably bound up together, subject to the same laws, and composed of the same divine substance. There was initially no ontological gulf between the world of the gods and the world of men and women. When people spoke of the divine, they were usually talking about an aspect of the mundane. The very existence of the gods was inseparable from that of a storm, a sea, a river, or from those powerful human emotions &#x2014; love, rage or sexual passion &#x2014; that seemed momentarily to lift men and women onto a different plane of existence so that they saw the world with new eyes. <br><br>Mythology was therefore designed to help us to cope with the problematic human predicament. It helped people to find their place in the world and their true orientation. We all want to know where we came from, but because our earliest beginnings are lost in the mists of prehistory, we have created myths about our forefathers that are not historical but help to explain current attitudes about our environment, neighbours and customs. We also want to know where we are going, so we have devised stories that speak of a posthumous existence &#x2014; though, as we shall see, not many myths envisage immortality for human beings. And we want to explain those sublime moments, when we seem to be transported beyond our ordinary concerns. The gods helped to explain the experience of transcendence. The perennial philosophy expresses our innate sense that there is more to human beings and to the material world than meets the eye.</p><h2>By Signs and Wonders</h2><p>As the church in North America trends toward a casual, cultural expression of Christianity, a surprising thing is happening. Instead of becoming more relevant, it's becoming less. <br><br> In By Signs and Wonders: How the Holy Spirit Grows the Church, Steve Elliott takes a close look at evangelism. How did the Good News of Jesus Christ spread in the years following Jesus's life? What methods has God used to see entire communities converted in the great revivals of the past? Why has the recent rise of friendship/lifestyle evangelism fallen so short of producing disciples? <br><br> As you'll see in these pages, the fastest-growing denominations and local churches around the world today are far more reliant on a strategy apart from friendship/lifestyle evangelism. This is the focus of this book, to provide laity and Christian leaders with a critically important insight in how to more effectively evangelize a lost and dying world.</p><p></p><h2>Phase Line Green: The Battle for Hue, 1968</h2><p>The bloody, month-long battle for the Citadel in Hue during 1968 pitted U.S. Marines against an entrenched, numerically superior North Vietnamese Army force. By official U.S. accounts it was a tactical and moral victory for the Marines and the United States. But a survivor's compulsion to square official accounts with his contrasting experience has produced an entirely different perspective of the battle, the most controversial to emerge from the Vietnam War in decades.<br><p>In some of the most frank, vivid prose to come out of the war, author Nicholas Warr describes with urgency and outrage the Marines' savage house-to-house fighting, ordered without air, naval, or artillery support by officers with no experience in this type of deadly combat. Sparing few in the telling, including himself, Warr's shocking firsthand narrative of these desperate suicide charges, which devastated whole companies, takes the wraps off an incident that many would prefer to keep hidden. His account is sure to ignite heated debate among historians and military professionals.<br></p><p>Despite senseless rules of engagement and unspeakable carnage, there were unforgettable acts of courage and self-sacrifice performed by ordinary men asked to accomplish the impossible, and Warr is at his best relating these stories. For example, there's the grenade-throwing mortarman who in a rage wipes out two machine-gun emplacements that had pinned down an entire company for days, and the fortunate grunt with thick glasses who stumbles blindly--without receiving a scratch--across a street littered with the dead and dying who hadn't made it. In describing the most vicious urban combat since World War II, this account offers an unparalleled view of how a small unit commander copes with the conflicting demands and responsibilities thrust upon him by the enemy, his men, and the chain of command. </p></p><p>The bloody monthlong battle for the Citadel in Hue pitted U.S. Marines against an entrenched North Vietnamese Army force.

At the age of four, he became the dauphin, heir to the most powerful throne in Europe. Yet within five years he was to lose everything. Drawn into the horror of the French Revolution, his family was incarcerated and their fate thrust into the hands of the revolutionaries who wished to destroy the monarchy.<br><br>In 1793, when Marie Antoinette was beheaded at the guillotine, she left her adored eight-year-old son imprisoned in the Temple Tower. Far from inheriting a throne, the orphaned boy-king had to endure the hostility and abuse of a nation. Two years later, the revolutionary leaders declared Louis XVII dead. No grave was dug, no monument built to mark his passing.<br><br>Immediately, rumors spread that the prince had, in fact, escaped from prison and was still alive. Others believed that he had been murdered, his heart cut out and preserved as a relic. As with the tragedies of England's princes in the Tower and the Romanov archduchess Anastasia, countless "brothers" soon approached Louis-Charles's older sister, Marie-Therese, who survived the revolution. They claimed not only the dauphin's name, but also his inheritance. Several "princes" were plausible, but which, if any, was the real heir to the French throne?<br>The Lost King of France is a moving and dramatic tale that interweaves a pivotal moment in France's history with a compelling detective story that involves pretenders to the crown, royalist plots and palace intrigue, bizarre legal battles, and modern science. The quest for the truth continued into the twenty-first century, when, thanks to DNA testing, the strange odyssey of a stolen heart found within the royal tombs brought an exciting conclusion to the two-hundred-year-old mystery of the lost king of France.<br></p><p><b>Deborah Cadbury</b> is an award-winning journalist specializing in the fundamental issues of science and history and their effects on today's society.

On departure, in the courtyard in front of the palace, the royal entourage assembled. Two grand <i>berlines</i> lavishly upholstered in blue and crimson velvet and decorated with fine embroidery had been provided by the French ambassador to take Maria-Antonia to Paris. These were to be conveyed in a cavalcade of almost fifty carriages, each to be drawn by six horses, and an array of guards and out-riders. The whole of the Austrian court, in all its silken and bejewelled finery, attended this auspicious event. Maria-Antonia, the youngest daughter of the distinguished Empress Maria-Theresa and Emperor Franz I, was to marry the future king of France and, it was hoped, consolidate Austria's troubled relationship with France.Maria-Antonia was slightly built with all the attractiveness of youth. "She has a most graceful figure; holds herself well; and if, as may be hoped, she grows a little taller, she will possess every good quality one could wish for in a great princess," wrote her tutor, the Abb� Jacques de Vermond, adding, "her heart and character are both excellent." Maria-Antonia hadlarge blue eyes, reddish blond hair and a good complexion; many even considered her a beauty. The aging French king, Louis XV, eagerly inquiring about the prospective Austrian bride for his grandson was told by officials that she had "a charming face and beautiful eyes." She had, however, inherited the Habsburg projecting lower lip and prominent brow, which prompted her mother, in preparations for the event, to bring a <i>coiffeur</i> from France to arrange her hair to soften the line of her forehead.Maria-Antonia, the subject of all this detailed scrutiny, had had her future determined when she was thirteen. "Others make war but thou, O happy Austria, makest marriages" was a family motto. Her mother, the Empress Maria-Theresa, who was widely considered to be the best queen in Europe since Elizabeth I of England, ruled the Habsburg Empire. Her territories encompassed most of central Europe, reaching to parts of Romania in the east, regions of Germany in the north, south to Lombardy and Tuscany in Italy and west to the Austrian Netherlands, now Belgium. Some of this success was due to a series of strategic marriages, which were an important part of royal diplomacy. Maria-Antonia was the youngest of sixteen children, and several of her older sisters had already taken part in Austrian foreign policy. One sister was married to the governor general of the Austrian Netherlands, another became the Duchess of Parma, and a third, Maria-Antonia's favorite sister, Maria-Carolina, had become the queen of Naples--a role that at first she deplored. "The suffering is true martyrdom," Maria-Carolina wrote home, "made worse by being expected to look happy ... I pity Antonia who has yet to suffer it."For the Empress Maria-Theresa, eclipsing all these marriages was the prospect of an alliance with the French. France was seen as the richest and most powerful state in Europe, and, with twenty-five million people, also the largest. Yet France had been Austria's enemy for over two hundred years. For many, a permanent alliance between the two former long-standing enemies seemed out of the question, even potentially dangerous. However, the empress was determined to secure a match between her youngest daughter and the dauphin of France. Such an important marriage would seal a politicalalliance and enable the two countries to work as allies against the growing Prussian influence.Despite the exciting prospects that lay ahead, Maria-Antonia's departure from her home, and her mother in particular, was still an ordeal, according to one witness, Joseph Weber, the son of her former nurse. "The young Maria-Antonia burst into tears and the spectators, touched by the sight, shared the cruel sufferings of mother and daughter. Maria-Theresa ... took her into her arms and hugged her ... . 'Adieu, my dear daughter; a great distance is going to separate us, but be just, be humane and imbued with a sense of the duties of your rank and I will always be proud of the regrets which I shall always feel ... . Do so much good to the people of France that they will be able to say that I have sent them an angel.'" As her carriage departed, Maria-Antonia, "her face bathed with tears, covered her eyes now with a handkerchief, now with her hands, and put her head out of the window again and again, to see once more the palace of her fathers to which she would never return." All she had to represent her future was a miniature portrait of her future husband, Louis-Auguste, the dauphin.Her magnificent cort�ge travelled for a week through Austria and Bavaria until finally they reached the frontier with France, on the banks of the Rhine River near Kehl. On an island in the middle of the river, Maria-Antonia had to undergo a ceremony in which she was symbolically stripped of her Austrian roots and was then reborn, robed in French attire. A magnificent wooden pavilion, over a hundred feet long, had been constructed, divided into two main sections. On one side were the courtiers from Vienna and on the other, from France. Once the formal ceremonies were completed the door to the French side was opened, and Maria-Antonia had to make her entrance into the French court, no longer as Maria-Antonia, but Marie-Antoinette. As she realized that the door to the Austrian side had closed behind her on all those familiar faces, she was overwhelmed, and "rushed" into the French side, "with tears in her eyes."As she continued her journey into France she received a rapturous welcome. Every kind of extravagant preparation had been taken to honor theyoung princess. There were displays of all kinds; fireworks, dances, theater, great triumphal arches built, petals strewn before her feet, floating gardens on the river beneath her window, fountains flowing with wine, endless enthusiastic crowds, cheer upon cheer. If she had left the Austrian court in tears, her slow progress through France to such approbation could only fill her with every possible hope.By May 14 she arrived at Compi�gne, some forty miles northeast of Paris, where she was to meet her future husband, the dauphin, Louis-Auguste. Marie-Antoinette, by now well briefed on etiquette by her new advisor, the eminent Comtesse de Noailles, stepped from her carriage and sank into a deep curtsy before the king. Louis XV was still a handsome man whose regal presence eclipsed that of the shy and somewhat overweight sixteen-year-old standing next to him. If she was disappointed by her first impressions of her future husband, there is no record of it. Others, however, have left a less-than-favorable account. "Nature seems to have denied everything to Monsieur le dauphin," Maria-Theresa's ambassador in France had reported, somewhat harshly. "In his bearing and words, the prince displays a very limited amount of sense, great plainness and no sensitivity." Indeed, the tall, ungainly youth was more than a little awkward with his prospective bride. When Marie-Antoinette politely kissed him he seemed unsure of himself and promptly moved away.It took twenty-three days from leaving the Hofburg in Vienna before they reached Versailles on May 16, 1770. As the cavalcade of carriages turned into the drive that sunny morning the vast scale of the magnificent chateau came into view. Once the dream of the Sun King, Louis XIV, who had transformed it from a hunting lodge to a sumptuous estate and symbol of royal power, Versailles gave off an immediate impression of classical grandeur, ionic columns, arched windows and balustrades receding into the distance as far as the eye could see. The ornamental facade of the main block alone, in brick and honey-colored stone, stretched over one-third of a mile. This was the administrative center of Europe's most powerful state, nothing less than a town for up to ten thousand people: the royal family and theirentourage, several thousand courtiers and their servants, the king's household troops, Swiss guards, musketeers, gendarmes and countless other staff and visitors.Marie-Antoinette was taken to the ground-floor apartments where her ladies-in-waiting were to prepare her for her wedding. But nothing was to prepare the princess for the lavishness of the palace; the Hofburg in Austria was modest by comparison. The reception rooms were of an unbelievable richness and elegance, and the draped and canopied beds of the royal apartments had more in common with Cleopatra's silken barge than the planks and straw of the common lot. Then there were the endless mirrored panels of the vast <i>Galerie des Glaces</i> where courtiers were assembling to greet her. This famous Hall of Mirrors was the talk of Europe, with its four hundred thousand reflected candles, and beyond, the tall western windows; the perfect view with its enchanted blue distance held forever in mirrors, gold and more gold, the sparkle of diamonds and the finest crystal. It could not fail to seduce the senses and beguile the emperor's daughter as to her assured prospects at Versailles.The marriage ceremony took place later that day in the gilt and white chapel at Versailles. In this regal setting, Bourbon kings were traditionally christened and married, secure in the knowledge of their "divine right" as monarch. Standing before the carved marble altar, the dauphin, dressed in cloth of gold studded with diamonds, found the whole procedure something of an ordeal.

Exploring topics such as the existence of God, God&#x2019;s relationship to the world and to history, how to read the Bible, Jewish mysticism, the evolution of Judaism, and more, Andrew Pessin makes key insights from the Jewish philosophical tradition accessible and engaging. Short chapters share fascinating insights from ancient times to today, from Philo to Judith Plaskow.

Pessin has written an outstanding overview of Jewish thought which I found moving and informative.

(<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>In eighty-seven brief chapters, Pessin offers an informative and highly readable survey of what Jewish thinkers, from antiquity through the twenty-first century, have had to say about God and related topics.

Paddling North is a compilation of Sutherland&#x2019;s first two (of over 20) such annual trips and her day-by-day travels through the Inside Passage from Ketchikan to Skagway.

The preeminent-and often the only-female correspondent on the scene, she broke new ground for women in the male preserve of journalism. Her wartime dispatches, marked by a passionate desire to expose suffering in its many guises and an inimitable immediacy, rank among the best of the twentieth century.<br><br>A deep-seated love of travel complemented this interest in world affairs. From her birth in St. Louis in 1908 to her death in London in 1998, Gellhorn passed through Africa, Cuba, China, and most of the great cities of Europe, recording her experiences in first-rate travel writing and fiction. A tall, glamorous blonde, she made friends easily-among the boldface names that populated her life were Eleanor Roosevelt, Leonard Bernstein, and H. G. Wells-but she was as incapable of settling into comfortable long-term relationships as she was of sitting still, and happiness often eluded her despite her professional success. Both of her marriages ended badly-the first, to Ernest Hemingway, publicly so. <br><br>Drawn from extensive interviews and with exclusive access to Gellhorn's papers and correspondence, this seminal biography spans half the globe and almost an entire century to offer an exhilarating, intimate portrait of one of the defining women of our times.<br></p><p><b>Caroline Moorehead </b>is a distinguished biographer, book reviewer, and journalist. Her biographies of Iris Origo and Bertrand Russell were both <i>New York Times </i>Notable Books.She will edit a collection of Gellhorn's letters, to be published by Henry Holt in 2004, and is also writing a book about the international refugee crisis. She lives in London.<br>New York with Hemingway was not what she expected. In Key West there had been time for long flirtatious meetings, time to talk seductively about writing and political commitments. In New York they were always in a crowd, everyone drinking, rushing in and out, answering the telephone, going to the Stork Club and Twenty One. Martha was frantic herself. She needed papers for Spain, and with some difficulty persuaded her friend Kyle Crichton at Collier's magazine to give her, not exactly a job, but a letter identifying her as their special correspondent. Martha also needed money for her boat ticket to Europe. Vogue obligingly commissioned her to write an article on "Beauty Problems of the Middle-Aged Woman," which involved acting as a guinea pig for a new experimental skin treatment. (It ruined her skin, she told a friend years later, but it got her to Spain.)<br><br>There was nothing now to keep her. Before boarding her ship, she wrote to Mrs. Barnes, a family friend in St. Louis: "Me, I am going to Spain with the boys.

But after the dual blows of his mother's early death and his father's breakdown upend his childhood, Erik and his younger siblings -- Louise and Conrad -- are scattered. Later, as an ambitious young composer, Erik flings himself into the Parisian art scene, aiming for greatness but achieving only notoriety. <br>As the years, then decades, pass, he alienates those in his circle as often as he inspires them, lashing out at friends and lovers like Claude Debussy and Suzanne Valadon. Only Louise and Conrad are steadfast allies. Together they strive to maintain their faith in their brother's talent and hold fast the badly frayed threads of family. But in a journey that will take her from Normandy to Paris to Argentina, Louise is rocked by a severe loss that ultimately forces her into a reckoning with how Erik -- obsessed with his art and hungry for fame -- will never be the brother she's wished for.<br>With her buoyant, vivid reimagination of an iconic artist's eventful life, Caitlin Horrocks has written a captivating and ceaselessly entertaining novel about the tenacious bonds of family and the costs of greatness, both to ourselves and to those we love.</p><p>Caitlin Horrocks is the author of the story collection <i>This Is Not Your City</i> and a recipient of the O.

She lives with her family in Grand Rapids, Michigan."Marvelous . . . Was [Erik Satie] a prophet or a prankster? To its credit, Ms. Horrocks's novel doesn't venture an answer. Instead, it wonderfully embellishes the world through which Satie wandered like some kind of marooned alien visitor."&#x2015;<b><i>Sam Sacks,<i> Wall Street Journal</i></i></b><br><br>"Vivid...Enthralling...Arresting."&#x2015;<b><i>Seth Colter Walls, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></i></b><br><br>"<i>The Vexations</i> builds to a devastating conclusion, but it's worth the pain for this unusual, quietly beautiful meditation on the work and strife behind art that has endured for generations."&#x2015;<b><i>Bethanne Patrick, <i>Washington Post</i></i></b><br><br>"Affecting . . . An engrossing debut . . . Horrocks writes enchantingly about the bohemian life of artists in Montmartre . . . Her language is lyrical and captivating . . . The novel reads like a finely composed piece of music, swiftly interweaving winsome sentences with period details and the characters who lived them. From the use of a pneumatic tube messaging system under the city to the introduction of the telephone, <i>The Vexations</i> presents itself as a window into a textured past made real and tangible for the reader . . . What's most extraordinary about <i>The Vexations</i> is the writing itself. There is the risk with historical fiction that the research will be heavy-handed, to the dilution of story. Horrocks's vast knowledge of French history and classical music is on display, but the bounty of information never overwhelms . . . The multiple points of view offer the reader perspectives and arcs another novel might otherwise deem too minor to allow; each character is compelling enough in their own right. In using various narrations, Horrocks shines a brighter light on <i>la Belle �poque</i>, showing the period was composed of people beyond the already established artists . . . This narrated mosaic illuminates how Satie's ambitions were shaped by or existed alongside those of his family and friends . . . The novel's ending, narrated by [Satie's sister] Louise, is what makes <i>The Vexations</i> as extraordinary as Erik himself. Louise closes by centering completely on his genius. Every sentence Horrocks writes is a stepping-stone to this apex, and satisfying to such a degree that the reader will have the urge to close the book and begin listening to Satie's music."&#x2015;<b><i>Rachel Duboff,<i> Los Angeles Review of Books</i></i></b><br><br>"By writing her male virtuoso [Erik Satie] from the inside and outside, Horrocks creates <b>a wrenching portrait of overconfidence as a destructive force.</b>"&#x2015;<b><i>Lili Meyer,<i> The Atlantic</i></i></b><br><br>"I've rarely seen a debut as buoyant and inspired as Caitlin Horrocks's <i>The Vexations</i>. In language both champagne-clear and effortlessly lively, Horrocks plumbs the world of Erik Satie through those closest to him, the siblings, friends, and lovers who struggle to support and understand him even as his obsessions isolate and score him deeper than anyone can reach. As much about the vexations and impossibilities of life itself as about Satie's singular genius, this is a dazzling first novel from a writer to watch."&#x2015;<b><i>Paula McLain, author of <i>The Paris Wife </i>and <i>Love and Ruin</i></i></b><br><br>"In this melodic tale, first novelist Horrocks reimagines the rich ferment of fin de si�cle Paris, with cameos by Cocteau and Debussy."&#x2015;<b><i><i>O, Oprah Magazine</i></i></b><br><br>"Horrocks's opening chapters are deeply affecting in their portrayal of childhood grief and are also among the novel's most vibrant, evoking the salt air and earthy people of the Norman coast while shifting between characters...Horrocks shines as she renders the Montmartre demimonde in Day-Glo colors, as provocative as a Toulouse-Lautrec canvas. Deftly she plumbs the singular zeal--and occasional neuroses--that drive artists toward achievement as well as self-destruction...Cameos from Jean Cocteau and Claude Debussy add sparkle...<i>The Vexations</i> explores grand themes with grace and conviction."&#x2015;<b><i>Hamilton Caine,<i> Minneapolis Star Tribune</i></i></b><br><br>"A beguiling debut . . . As a title, <i>The Vexations</i> befits a novel about the uncompromising genius of a man who by the end of his life appears to have alienated everyone he cared about. However, if this makes it sound like Satie is Horrocks's unique focus that would be misleading. <i>The Vexations</i> contains a richly arranged cast of characters, all of whom rub up against each other in the streets, cabarets, and caf�s of Montmartre, Paris, on the cusp of the twentieth century. Most vivid among these are Satie's younger sister, Louise, and brother, Conrad . . . Horrocks's gliding prose scatters grace notes on every page. There is also a questing meditation on the nature of genius, expressed by Louise in her role as a teacher . . . Horrocks's version of Satie, despite or perhaps because of his many failings, emerges as a strangely heroic figure."&#x2015;<b><i>Tobias Grey, <i>Financial Times</i></i></b><br><br>"A heartbreakingly beautiful novel about the sacrifices people make for what they hold dear."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Library Journal</i> (starred review)</i></b></p><h2>The Hole in the Wall Ranch, A History</h2><p>The Hole in the Wall country of Wyoming&#39;s Bighorn Mountains is well known to history buffs steeped in Butch Cassidy lore, but for millennia it&#39;s been a crossroads for all kinds of people.

He is the current writer of Adventures of Superman and Wonder Woman. Michael Lark has worked on prestigious titles including The Invisibles, JSA, The Sandman and Terminal City.Of DC Comics' dozen or so monthly Batman-related titles, <i>Gotham Central</i> is outstanding. It focuses on the police detectives who tackle Gotham City's street-level criminals while the Caped Crusader confronts the costumed crooks. The premise grounds the series in recognizable reality, even though the plainclothes protagonists can't avoid crossing paths with the superpowered felons associated with Batman. The stories collected here feature Renee Montoya, scorned by fellow detectives when her homosexuality is revealed and subsequently framed for a murder. The tense atmosphere of the squad room and the morally ambiguous world of cops and crooks evoke contemporary crime stories in other media; <i>Gotham Central</i> is like <i>The Shield</i> more than like <i>Hill Street Blues. </i>Prolific comics scripter and successful mystery author Rucka devises a deft mash-up of the superhero saga and the police procedural, but Lark's shadowy, understated artwork is equally crucial to the success of the series' realistic stories, as two inferior pieces set more firmly in conventional Batman continuity and illustrated in standard superhero style make quite clear by contrast. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

But William, who walks to the beat of his own drummer, dawdles in bed, talks to himself and makes funny faces in the mirror, then has a leisurely time in the overflowing tub. Afterwards, he feeds his fish Pinky and tells him a story. Inevitably, William misses his bus, but he makes his own picnic, only to be joined by his siblings when the class party, naturally, is rained out. Brightly colored cartoon illustrations, sometimes divided into smaller panels, are full of humorous detail to balance the minimal handprinted text within dialogue balloons. The buck-toothed pigs, charmingly pictured on spreads showing dozens of them romping at the picnic, have a lot of vitality. Pig William is extremely childlike as he doggedly and cheerfully pursues his morning routine and rituals, unconcerned by the passing of time. Parents of children who have their own self-set pace and ritualized activities will find this slice-of-life portrayal wonderfully funny. Children themselves will love it.

The youngest porcine dawdles maddeningly while the others rush through morning chores so they won't miss the bus taking all the neighborhood children to the class picnic at Porky Park. William is left behind when the bus leaves with everyone else on board. In a gleeful switch, however, he arranges a picnic for himself and his beloved goldfish, Pinky. And his brothers arrive home in time to enjoy the fun when their outing is canceled by rain. It's all the ridiculous extras in Dubanevich's sunny-colored pictures that make her books irresistible. <br>Copyright 1985 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Picturing Atrocity: Photography in Crisis</h2><p><p></p>Ever since the landmark publication of Susan Sontag&#x2019;s <i>On Photography, </i>it has been impossible to look at photographs, particularly those of violence and suffering, without questioning our role as photographic voyeur. Are we desensitized by the proliferation of these images, and does this make it easier to be passive and uninvolved? Or do the images immediately stir our own sense of justice and act as a call to arms? Are we consuming the suffering of others as a form of intrigue? Or is it an act of empathy?&nbsp;To answer these questions, <i>Picturing Atrocity</i> brings together essays from some of the foremost writers and critics on photography today, including Rebecca Solnit, Alfredo Jaar, Ariella Azoulay, Shahidul Alam, John Lucaites, Robert Hariman, and Susan Meiselas, to offer close readings of images that reveal the realities behind the photographs, the subjects, and the photographers. From the massacre of the Sioux Indians at Wounded Knee to the torture of prisoners at Abu Ghraib, from famine in China to apartheid in South Africa, <i>Picturing Atrocity</i> examines a broad spectrum of photographs. Each of the essays focuses specifically on an iconic image, offering a distinct approach and context, in order to enable us to look again&#x2014;and this time more closely&#x2014;at the picture. In addition, four photo-essays showcase the work of photographers involved in the making of photographs of brutality as well as the artists&#x2019; own reflections on these images.&nbsp;Together these essays cover the historical and geographical range of atrocity photographs and respond to current concerns about such disturbing images; they probe why we as viewers feel compelled to look even when our instinct might be to look away. <i>Picturing Atrocity</i> is an important read, not just for insights into photography, but for its reflections on human injustice and suffering. In keeping with that aim, all royalties from the book will be donated to Amnesty International.<p></p></p><p><p> </p><b>Geoffrey Batchen</b> is a photography historian and professor of art history at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. <b>Mick Gidley</b> is emeritus professor of American literature and culture at the University of Leeds. <b>Nancy K.

Multilayered and lucid, these essays demolish any lingering pretence that images of suffering can be understood without also considering the context and media in which they are presented, and the often far-from-the-scene viewer who consumes them. <i>Picturing Atrocity</i> is critical reading for communicators in the aid, development and human rights communities who participate in the dissemination of these essential but volatile images.&#x201d;</p> (Ellen Tolmie, UNICEF Sr. Photography Editor)<br><br><p>&#x201c;It is hard to look: My Lai, Dachau, Abu Ghraib, Wounded Knee. We know these atrocities through the painful evidence of unforgettable documentary photographs. But these images are far from innocent. Just as &#x2018;atrocity&#x2019; itself is a loaded term, every photograph of such an event is a bit of high-level propaganda in a moralized political argument, encouraging the viewer to bear witness, make judgments, take sides. This important new collection of essays by some of the most brilliant analysts of photography shows how deliberately horrifying pictures have shaped&#x2014;and continue to shape&#x2014;the ethics and politics of the modern era.&#x201d;</p> (Brian Wallis, Chief Curator, International Center of Photography, New York <i>Brian Wallace, International Center of Photography</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;There are some subtle and effective examinations of the space where art and horror meet, and what&#x2019;s notable throughout is the way the text surrounds the terrible images in an almost Lilliputian attempt to restrain their power.&#x201d; (<i>The Australian</i>)<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;For all the monographic studies and collected volumes, however, even those devoted specifically to photography, none has explored the terrain as expansively or assiduously as <i>Picturing Atrocity</i>. . . . An ambitious and important book, each essay offering an illuminating encounter with a fragment of the photographic archive of injustice and suffering. . . . As much an encounter with the history of modernity as it is with the medium of photography, <i>Picturing Atrocity </i>is a deeply ethical study of images. . . . This volume, with its concise yet purposeful introduction by Jay Prosser and its consistently persuasive and engaging essays by the other editors and contributors, makes a case for why photography, whatever its forms, mattered then, matters now, and will continue to matter in the years to come.&#x201d; (<i>CAA reviews</i>)</p><h2>We Were There: A Nativity Story</h2><p>On a winter night long ago, a baby boy was born in a stable with only the animals to witness his arrival.

Here Bunting shares the view of seven other creatures that were also witnesses on that special night. Snake, toad, scorpion, cockroach, bat, spider, and rat all offer a brief poem, always ending with the refrain, "I will be there." Minor's gouache-and-watercolor illustrations feature zoomed-in views of each narrator and occasional double-page spreads from one animal's perspective (snake on a vast expanse of sand, rat nestled in the straw). The last line sums up, "No one will look/beyond the light/to darkness/and the corner where we watch,/unwatched./They will not know/or care./But we were there." Libraries with active Christmas collections will want to add this title for its unique perspective. The poetry may inspire youngsters to create verses of their own for other "less loved" creatures.-G. C.BYRD, Donald &amp; Susan Kuklin. The Harlem Nutcracker. photos. by Susan Kuklin. unpaged. CIP.

The choreography is jazz dancing, not classical ballet." The beautifully designed book captures the stage production featuring an African-American grandmother named Clara and her family at her Sugar Hill mansion in Harlem on Christmas Eve. Her husband Gus, who has recently passed away, magically appears and presents her with a nutcracker, before vanishing. The family gathering presents conflict, drama, happiness, and love and, in the end, the nutcracker is passed to a new generation and Clara joins her beloved Gus in death. Readers can enjoy the story, whether they are actually reading the text or simply looking at the lavish, powerful photographs of onstage action-but perhaps because of this live-action quality, some of the shots are not quite as crisp as others. This fresh reinterpretation of the holiday classic will hold a special appeal for young people familiar with the original and for budding performers.-L.

Robert Ingpen lives in Anglesea, Australia.K-Gr. 3. The history of the internationally known Christmas carol, <i>Silent Night--</i>how it was composed and first sung, and its connections across time and place--is celebrated in this handsome, oversize picture book. The young priest who wrote the poem and the composer who set it to music first performed their carol one Christmas in the early nineteenth century as a gift for their poverty-stricken, war-torn Austrian village. Ingpen (a Hans Christian Andersen Medal winner) evokes the old European masters in moving portraits as well as crowded candlelit interiors. One heartbreaking spread, in shades of gray and brown, reconstructs the famous World War I Christmas truce, when enemies sang the carol together and then went back to killing. In contrast, the outdoor carol-singers, past and present, are painted in radiant color. Occasional overwriting ("visionary inspiration") notwithstanding, the history and the art make this a great holiday title, an elemental Christmas tale of humble beginnings and universal power. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

But the woman who was on her way to arrest, or rearrest, her favorite agent was getting short-tempered. Her name was Hilda Jeanne Morrisey. She had kept that name unchanged all her life, even through her two marriages--both of them brief, ancient and (as she now thought) pretty damn stupid, since there were so many less troublesome ways of having sex. Hilda Morrisey stood a hundred and sixty centimeters tall and weighed fifty kilograms, give or take a kilo or so. That weight also had not changed since her long-ago days as a police cadet, although it was true that it seemed to take more and more effort to keep it so. Her rank in the National Bureau of Investigation was full colonel. It had taken a lot of work on her part to keep that unchanged, too. Colonel Morrisey was long overdue for the promotion that the Bureau's higher brass kept trying to force on her.<br>The thing about that promotion wasn't that Hilda Morrisey objected to either the higher pay or the higher rank. What she minded was the consequences. Being promoted one step higher would automatically move her to a desk in the NBI headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, and Hilda hated desk jobs.<br>The place where she felt at home was in a communications truck in, say, Nebraska, commanding a raid on their rad-right religious militias, or flying high over the Sea of Marmara to listen to the furtive, coded reports of the agent she had run into the Kurdish command post somewhere on the slopes of Mt. Ararat. Or, for that matter, her present assignment in New York, which was recruiting bilingual Japanese-Americans to penetrate the car factories in Osaka, who were apparently violating the trade agreements by using New Guinea--made parts in their allegedly all-Japanese cars.<br>Anywhere, in short, but in a desk job. A brigadier's star was hers by right of seniority, but accepting it would cost her all those fun jobs. True, Bureau policy was "Up or Out," but not for Hilda. She had been beating that rule for years. When the personnel people got too antsy about her status they always had to buck the question up to the director himself. Who always said, "Hilda won't take Up, and she's just too damn good for Out. Give the silly bitch another waiver." And they always did.<br>The other thing about Colonel Hilda was that, even at never-mind-how-old, she was still a pretty neat-looking woman--which is to say one who had very little trouble in attracting any man who attracted her. Like, for instance, the man friend of the moment, Wilbur Carmichael, who--once this distasteful job was complete--she had every intention of giving a call that evening.<br>But the other thing about those jobs she liked so well was that every once in a while they had a bad spot. Like the present one, which required her to do something she really hated, namely to arrest--or rearrest--one of her own.<br>* * *<br>When they reached the corner of Jim Daniel Dannerman's block Sergeant McEvoy had to slam on the brakes to avoid hitting the overflow from a minor riot going on. Two sidewalk vendors were having an argument in the snow. It had gotten violent. Punches were being thrown, and one of them had overturned the other's tray of inflation-beating collectibles. Tarot cards and genuine guaranteed simulated Confederate currency were all over the sludgy, gray-black snow at the curb. The bystanders had joined in, and two street cops were doing their best to cool everybody down. When they caught sight of Master Sergeant McEvoy's uniform they hastily cleared a path for the Bureau van.<br>In front of Dannerman's apartment building Hilda unbuckled herself and looked over at the sergeant. "Target status?"<br>Sergeant McEvoy already had his head down over his instrument panel. "He's back in his room. He got himself one of those gyro sandwiches at the place on the corner and took it back to his room to eat."<br>"I hope he eats fast," Hilda said, stepping out into wet slush.<br>A little man was waddling hastily toward her. He wore a fleece jacket, a wool cap and an armband that said <i>Neighborhood Watch</i> and he was shaking, of all things, a golf club at her. A golf club! Obviously one of those nuts who had some sort of airy-fairy objection to carrying a gun like everybody else. He was belligerent enough for anybody, though. "Move it, lady!" he barked. "No double-parking today; you got to leave room for the plows to get through." Then, as he caught sight pf the sergeant stepping out of the other side of the van--Sergeant Horace McEvoy, in full Federal Police Force uniform, big as a house and with his hand on the butt, of his shotgun, the man added, "Oh." He didn't look impressed. He just looked surly, but he backed out of the way.<br>As Hilda got out of the elevator on Dannerman's floor she saw the landlady peeking at her out of one of the rooms. Clearly the woman recognized Hilda Morrisey. She didn't say anything, though she was looking surly, too.<br>The colonel let herself into Dannerman's room with her own key, and caught him in the act of taking off his wet socks. He was sober, if unshaved. He didn't look like the agent she had commanded through a dozen tough assignments, but then no one could look like an agent when he was wearing a house-arrest radio collar. "Oh, shit, Hilda," he said, wearily but unsurprised. "Don't you ever knock? I could've been doing something private."<br>"You don't have anything private anymore, Danno," she told him. "Did you sign that release yet?"<br>He touched his spy collar. "You know damn well that I didn't."<br>She nodded, since it was the truth, but only said, "Then put your socks back on. They want you in Arlington. You can eat your lunch on the plane."<br>* * *<br>Dannerman didn't ask any questions--not in his room, not in the car that took them to the VTOL pad by the river, not on the way to Arlington. He chewed away at his cold and congealing lamb sandwich with full attention. He didn't even ask for anything to drink with it. When the sandwich was all swallowed and its paper wrappings neatly stowed in the seat back, Dannerman closed his eyes. He kept them that way until the plane circled the Washington Monument, preparing to set down at the Bureau's pad across the Potomac. Colonel Morrisey approved. It was precisely the way she would have comported herself if, unimaginably, she had ever found herself in his position.<br>Hilda Morrisey was as fond of Dannerman as she ever let herself get of any of the field agents she was charged to run. She certainly didn't <i>spoil</i> them, but they were--well--family. As long as they remembered that she was the head of their family, with the power to punish or, occasionally, reward, Hilda gave them her unflinching support and even a little bit of as much as she had to give in the way of affection. Dannerman, how, had had quite a lot of both. The man was often a pain in the ass, and irritatingly likely to go off on tangents of his own, and at such times he needed to be brought back in line. But he generally got the job done.<br>Hilda's affection for Dan Dannerman wasn't sexual. At least it wasn't exactly sexual, though at rare times when she had nothing better to do she had let herself daydream a little about Danno as a stud. She certainly wasn't sexually jealous of him. She knew that he was currently banging some actress in that little theater group in Coney Island he played around with, plus God knew how many other previous women, now and then, when he was out in the field--well, God knew, but He wasn't the only one who knew. So did Hilda, because it was her business to know that sort of thing. She had sometimes even felt a little hostility toward the other women she knew Dannerman bedded, like that Kraut terrorist bimbo who had put him in the hospital. Hilda had to admit she'd enjoyed putting the cuffs on that one.<br>&nbsp;<br>Federal Reserve Inflation Bulletin<br>The morning recommended price adjustment for inflation is set at 0.37%, reflecting an annualized rate of 266%. Federal Reserve Chairman Walter C. Boettger predicts continuing moderation in the inflation rate for the next sixty days.<br>&nbsp;<br>But it didn't pay to think that way about Dan Dannerman. Not only could she not afford to get sexually involved with anyone in that much deep shit, but he was her property. The Bureau had strict rules about that. And so did she.<br>Dannerman opened his eyes at last when the sound of the plane's engines changed. They were switching to hover mode; they had arrived. While the plane was depositing itself on the landing pad by the three-story structure that was the visible part of the Bureau's headquarters, Hilda peered outside. Three people were waiting in the cold drizzle. It wasn't until they were out of the aircraft and Sergeant McEvoy and the two headquarters guards were hustling Dannerman away that Hilda realized that the third of the waiting men, his face obscured by the rain hood, was Deputy Director Marcus Pell himself .<br>Pell didn't offer to shake hands, and Colonel Morrisey didn't bother to salute. "Good to see you again, sir," she said, electing to be a little more deferential than usual. "Now, unless you've got something you need me here for, I guess I'll just catch the return flight."<br>He gave her the smile she specially disliked, the one that said he was about to give her an order she didn't want to hear. "Not today, Hilda. I want you to sit in on the Ananias team briefing before we interrogate your boy again."<br>"Sir! I've got this Japanese car-parts thing--"<br>"Screw the Japanese car parts. Don't look so unhappy; we've got some lunch for you, if you haven't eaten yet? Fine. Let's go."<br>There was no use arguing, but she hesitated. "What about Dannerman?"<br>"Well, what about Dannerman? He can sweat for a while. Do him good."<br>* * *<br>The Operation Ananias team had expanded since the last time Hilda visited Arlington. A dozen people waited in the deputy director's private briefing room, half of them strangers. As promised there was a small salad and a plate of sandwiches at each place on the blond-oak table, and big ceramic coffee jugs scattered handily about. Some people were eating, and that was good enough for her. As soon as she was seated she began to follow their example.<br>The deputy director, in no hurry to get started, was thoughtfully sipping at a cup of coffee while keying through his notepad. The men and women around the table were murmuring to each other or staring into space--except for the woman across the table, who was signaling for Hilda's attention. It was Pell's vice deputy, Daisy Fennell, She was pretending to scribble with one hand on the palm of the other, looking at Hilda with a questioningly raised eyebrow. Hilda got the message. She shook her head: no, Dannerman hadn't signed. Fennell pantomimed a sigh of resignation and went back to her own notepad.<br>Hilda chewed methodically (lettuce crisp, good; but whoever had had the idea of putting fruit-flavored dressing on it needed, reeducation) as she sorted out the people on the team. The screen ID'd the civilians at the table for her and the Bureau personnel were mostly easy: Daisy Fennell, two of the staff psychologists, the elderly Asian woman Who was in charge of electronic operations. That left one she couldn't quite place; a Bureau man, she was sure, but what was his specialty?<br>She got no help from Marcus Pell, either. As he refilled his coffee cup, he said, "Might as well get going. All you Bureau people know each other, of course, and I guess the rest of you have introduced yourselves around already. The colonel here is Hilda Morrisey, who has been Agent Dannerman's keeper. Hilda, this is Dr. Xiang-li Hou, from the Naval Observatory--" And he went around the table, repeating what the screen had already said. The stout black woman in the paisley dress turned out to be a cerebrospinal surgeon from Walter Reed; the two youngish women with me careworn looks were legislative liaison from, respectively, the Senate and the House, and one of them, surprisingly, had her senator sitting next to her. Alicia Piombero, the black woman from Georgia. (Not the worst of the senators, Hilda knew, but still the enemy: the damn Congress was, always trying to mess around in Bureau business.) The aggressively trim-looking man with the obvious hair transplant was a brigadier general from the Pentagon; the one who looked like a prosperous corporation lawyer was. Was some kind of a lawyer, at least, though his specialty wasn't given. He wasn't a bad-looking man, though. He might almost have been a somewhat older edition of Wilbur Carmichael, whom--Hilda glanced at her watch--if this damn meeting ever got itself over with, she might still get a chance to see that evening.<br>She looked up at Pell as he finished. "So now we all knew each other, and I'd like to thank all of you from outside the Bureau for volunteering your time to--I beg your pardon. Dr. Evergood?"<br>&nbsp;<br>Morning Report<br>To all National Bureau of Investigation units<br>Subject: Current terrorist alerts<br>Welsh Nationalist Dawid ap Llewellyn, sought in connection with the British Museum firebombing, has been reported in Mexico City, presumed en route to a United States destination.

The threatened release of anthrax agents in the Missoula, Montana, water supply has not occurred, but emergency measures are still in force.<br>All standing alerts remain in effect.<br>&nbsp;<br>The surgeon had raised her hand. "I said, 'Who volunteered?' It was put to me as an order."<br>"Which makes us even more grateful to you, Dr. Evergood," the deputy director said, smiling tolerantly. "What we're here for is a matter that urgently affects the national interest. You probably know some of the background, but I'm going to ask Vice Deputy Fennell to fill in some of the details. Daisy?"<br>The vice deputy didn't miss a beat. "You all remember the messages from space mat came in two years ago. Many people thought they were a hoax. A few did not. One of those was an astronomer named Dr. Patrice Adcock, head of the Dannerman Observatory in New York City, who believed they came from an abandoned astronomical satellite called Starlab.

She is the author of the Classic Theatre series. Annabelle lives in Madison, Connecticut, with her husband Forrest Stone and her two sons, Keele and Rye.Grade 2-5. While viewing a film about the building of the Great Pyramids of Egypt at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, Kevin is transported into King Khufu's burial chamber in the Great Pyramid as it is being built over 4,000 years ago. This book and tape introduce students to the building of the Great Pyramid through Kevin's eyes. Narration of this adventure and Kevin's thoughts are read by a male narrator whose voice resonates on the tape. Realistic sound effects add to the story as one hears the chiseling of the stones, voices at the pyramid, etc. Because the narrator does not follow the text exactly, this may be a confusing read-along. The historical facts, procedures, and vocabulary in the story are accurate. Kevin's thoughts are expressed in slang and shown in italics in the book. Included at the end of the book are a brief glossary and a few additional facts about the Great Pyramid. The book's watercolor illustrations produce a sense of being in there.

For most people, that would easily qualify as the holiday from hell. For George Gently, it is a case of business as usual. The Chief Inspector's quiet Easter break in Norchester is rudely interrupted when a local timber merchant is found dead. His son, with whom he had been seen arguing, immediately becomes the prime suspect, although Gently is far from convinced of his guilt.</p><p>Norchester City Police gratefully accept Gently's offer to help investigate the murder, but he soon clashes with Inspector Hansom, the officer in charge of the case. Hansom's idea of conclusive evidence appals Gently almost as much as Gently's thorough, detailed, methodical style of investigation exasperates Hansom, who considers the murder to be a straightforward affair.</p><p>Locking horns with the local law is a distraction Gently can do without when he's on the trail of a killer.</p></p><p><b>Alan Hunter</b> was born in Hoveton, Norfolk in 1922.

After she ignites a food demonstration in the cafeteria, her mother has had enough. With her pierced tongue, black fingernails, and dyed tomato-soup-red hair, the 12-year-old is unwillingly sent from London to live with her father and his new family in Ireland. Aghast at her new school and new home in rural Connemara, Scarlett is angry. Her outlet is the lough where she meets mysterious gypsy boy Kian and his horse, Midnight. He allows her to express herself and provides the escape and friendship she needs. Her nine-year-old stepsister also sneaks her way into Scarlett's heart, helping her to adjust. As she grows more penitent about her behavior, she makes the effort to change and becomes an important player in the family. Infused with a bit of fairy-tale magic, this is a fast-paced yet thoughtful story. The heroine is feisty and troublesome, yet quirky and lovable. Her feelings are justified, and readers will sympathize with her. The character develops tremendously as her anger ebbs and flows, transforming into sincere love and acceptance. Cassidy has written a poignant and strong story about love, forgiveness, and resilience.<i>&#x2013;Jennifer Cogan, Bucks County Free Library, Doylestown, PA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Anna Funder&#39;s bestselling Stasiland brings us extraordinary tales of real lives in the former East Germany. She meets Miriam who tried to escape to West Berlin as a sixteen-year-old, hears the heartbreaking story of Frau Paul, who was separated from her young baby the Berlin Wall, and gets drunk with the legendary &#34;Mik Jagger&#34; of the East, once declared by the authorities - to his face - &#39;no longer to exist&#39;. And she meets the Stasi men themselves, still proud of their surveillance methods.

She has worked as an international lawyer and a radio and television producer. In 1997 she was writer-in-residence at the Australia Centre in Potsdam. She lives in Sydney with her husband and baby.From the seventh chapter: <p>"Here, at the Normannenstrasse headquarters, there was panic. Stasi officers were instructed to destroy files, starting withthe most incriminating--those naming westerners who spied for them, and those that concerned deaths. They shredded the files until the shredders collapsed. Among other shortages in the east, there was a shredder shortage, so they had to send agents out under cover to West Berlin to buy more. In Building 8 alone, members of the citizens' movement found over one hundred burnt-out shredders. When the Stasi couldn't get any more machines, they started destroying the files by hand, ripping up documents and putting them into sacks. But this was done in such an orderly fashion--whole drawers of documents put into the same bag--that now, in Nuremberg, it is possible for the puzzle women to piece them back together."</p></p><h2>STAT 2331 Introduction to Statistical Methods</h2><p>Textbook for STAT 2331, Introduction to Statistical Methods, Southern Methodist University (SMU).</p><p></p><h2>Underwriting Commercial Property</h2><p>This book was purchased second-hand and has been gently used.</p><p></p><h2>ParaReading A Training Guide for Tutors Participant&#39;s Workbook (LETRS)</h2><p>Prepares paraprofessionals for the increasing demands place on them is today&#39;s schools.

Two cows ran off immediately while the third stood her ground. Her reward was, for the next 76 days, the constant and thorough attention bestowed on her by the gentle but confused moose. The saga of the ``love-sick moose'' (as he was to be termed by national and international press) is well told in this photographic essay. The text weaves the natural history of moose into the story of the unusual ``courtship'' between species. It also tells the story of the people who became involved: the visited farmer's support and defense of the wild animal and the human response to the rare event. The text, based on the farmer's log, is supplemented by over 50 quality, full-color photographs. A book that is funny and touching, and full of reverence for nature. Catherine Wood, Shelburne Museum, Vt.<br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.An engrossing account of the 76-day visit of a moose to the Carrara farm, but one that occasionally is bogged down by a detail-laden text. One day last fall the Carraras spotted a moose on their property. Ignoring them, the moose was in search of a mate. He chose Jessica, one of their cows, and lingered at the farm for a couple of months before shedding his antlers and heading off to his winter location. Over 70,000 people came to the Carrara farm to see the lovers, who were the focus of national media attention. This true story includes general information about the eating, sleeping, mating and wanderings of the moose, but it could have been a little more taut in the telling; the impact of the tale is diluted. However, this remains an entertaining story of a real romance between a Vermont family and a surprising autumn visitor.

This book traces the development of marriage and the family from the Middle Ages to the early modern era. It describes how the Roman and barbarian cultural streams merged under the influence of the Christian church to forge new concepts, customs, laws, and practices. Century by century it follows the development -- sometimes gradual, at other times revolutionary -- of significant elements in the history of the family:</p><ul><li>The basic functions of the family as production unit, as well as its religious, social, judicial, and educational roles.<br></li><li>The shift of marriage from private arrangement between families to public ceremony between individuals, and the adjustments in dowry, bride-price, and counter-dowry.<br></li><li>The development of consanguinity rules and incest taboos in church law and lay custom.<br></li><li>The peasant family in its varying condition of being free or unfree, poor, middling, or rich.<br></li><li>The aristocratic estate, the problem of the younger son, and the disinheritance of daughters.<br></li><li>The Black Death and its long-term effects on the family.</li><li>Sex attitudes and customs: the effects of variations in age of men and women at marriage.<br></li><li>The changing physical environment of noble, peasant, and urban families.<br></li><li>Arrangements by families for old age and retirement.</li></ul><p></p></p><p><p>Frances (1915&#x2013;2013) and Joseph (1916&#x2013;2006) Gies were the world&#x2019;s bestselling historians of medieval Europe.

They lived in Michigan.</p><p></p>Two experienced popular historians have assembled a well-researched and well-written overview of a lively topic in medieval scholarship, the history of the family. They start from the Roman, Germanic, and Christian backgrounds of medieval family life, cover its recently discovered 11th- and 12th-century transformations, and exploit the rich late medieval examples of family life. Among other topics the authors treat family definition and size, marriage rules and customs, and sexual relations.

(<i>Los Angeles Times - Robert R. Kirsch</i>)</p><h2>Cosmic Pulse of Life: The Revolutionary Biological Power Behind Ufo&#39;s</h2><p>This book presents evidence that UFOs are mainly invisible and consist of both physical craft and living, biological creatures. The author convincingly shows that our atmosphere is the home of huge, invisible living organisms that are sometimes confused with spacecraft when they became visible. Mr. Constable has photographed both types of UFOs with special infrared film, some of which are reproduced in this expanded and updated edition. Despite his bold leap into the future, the general public and official ufology have a hard time accepting the evidence. In recent years teams of engineers and technicians in both Italy and Romania, unaware of Constable&#39;s earlier discoveries, obtained virtually identical infrared photos of UFOs, which were published in Italy. In 1996, NASA used ultraviolet-sensitive videotape to record swarms of invisible UFOs that looked like Constable&#39;s earlier photos. Examples from these photos are also contained in this book. Also covered are earlier pioneers into important life energies that play a big role in this research, including Wilhelm Reich, Rudolf Steiner, and Dr. Ruth B. Drown. This is an important book, recommended for those interested in the higher realms of our physical reality.</p><p></p><h2>Prehistoric Stone Monuments (The World Heritage)</h2><p>Explores the origins and significance of the great stone monuments dating from the Neolithic Age which are found throughout Western Europe</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: SpanishGrade 6-8-Two brief series entries that attempt to do too much and offer too little.

MacDonald was born in Pennsylvania and married Dorothy Prentiss in 1937, graduating from Syracuse University the following year and receiving an MBA from Harvard in 1939. It was Dorothy who was responsible for the publication of his first work, when she submitted a short story that he had sent home while on military service. It was initially rejected by Esquire but went on to be published by Story magazine - and so began MacDonald&#39;s writing career. One of the best-loved and most successful of all the masters of hard-boiled crime and suspense, John D. Macdonald was producing brilliant fiction long after many of his contemporaries had been forgotten, and is still highly regarded today. The Executioners, possibly the best known of his non-series novels, was filmed as Cape Fear in 1962 and 1991, but many of the crime thrillers he produced between 1953 and 1964 are considered masterpieces, and he drew praise from such literary greats as Kurt Vonnegut and Stephen King, who declared him to be &#39;the great entertainer of our age, and a mesmerizing storyteller&#39;. His novels are often set in his adopted home of Florida, including those featuring his famous series character Travis McGee, which appeared between 1964 and 1985. He served as president of the Mystery Writers of America and in 1972 was elected a Grand Master, an honour granted only to the greatest crime writers of their generation, including Ross MacDonald, John Le Carre and P. D. James. He won many awards throughout his long career, and was the only mystery writer ever to win the National Book Award, for The Green Ripper.</p><h2>Telling the Truth About History</h2><p>Criticizes popular approaches to history, argues that it is worthwhile to pursue historical fact, and shows how to incorporate the overlooked roles of women and minorities when recreating the past</p><p>We have lost our grip on historical truth. Popular films depict subterranean conspiracies that shape historical events and public knowledge of those events. Best-selling narrative histories dissolve the border between fact and fiction, allowing the author&#39;s imagination to roam freely. Influential critics dissolve the author herself into one among many sources of meaning, reducing historical knowledge to a series of texts engaged with each other, not with the past. Powerful constituencies call for histories that affirm more than inform. This new book by three of our most accomplished historians engages the various criticisms that have fragmented the authority of historical knowledge. Although acknowledging degrees of legitimacy in the criticisms, the authors launch a pragmatic response that supports the historian, as they put it, in her long climb, notebook computer in tow, up the 300 stairs to the archives in Lyon. Even if historical truth is an ever-receding goal, the effort to approach it, they show, is legitimate, worthy, and governed by agreed-upon rules. And while affirming the claims of women and ethnic minorities to a rightful place in any narrative of American history, the authors insist on the accountability of history. They outline a coherent narrative of the American past that incorporates its multicultural dimension without special pleading.Joyce Appleby is professor of history at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p><h2>.hack// Another Birth Volume 2//Mutation_</h2><p>In order to save her younger brother, who lost consciousness while playing the online game &#34;The World,&#34; Akira must enter the fantasy world herself, which she does as the character BlackRose.</p><p></p><h2>Night Shift Daddy</h2><p>The touching picture book tells the story of a little girl and her Daddy and the moments they share together before he leaves for work at night and when he arrives home in the morning.</p><p>Eileen Spinelli has been writing since her father first gave her his old manual typewriter with a broken Z. Through school, work, marriage, children, and grandchildren, she wrote and wrote and wrote. Eileen&#39;s lyrical verse has graced the pages of more than 35 children&#39;s books, most recently Two to Cuddle from CandyCane Press. She is a featured poet in Ideals magazine and lives in Wayne, Pennsylvania, with her husband and fellow author, Jerry. There she continues to write with an electric typewriter in her cozy office on the second floor of their home.Spinelli (When Mama Comes Home Tonight) and debut artist Iwai inventively turn the tables in this winning bedtime book about a girl whose father works while she sleeps at night. Both art and text set a joyful opening scene, as the child's day winds down and her father gears up for work; a painting shows the man swinging his daughter up in the air in a yolk-colored kitchen, then settling in to read to her and her teddy bear. Together they look out the window onto the urban street belowDshaded by the fading winter light but still bustling with activityDbefore he tucks her in. The girl then steals to the window to watch her father wait at the bus stop below. With a narrative as quietly poetic as a snowfall ("He doesn't know I watch him go/ into the cold, the dark, the snow"), the story has a powerful cumulative effect. The artwork continues to build the relationship between father and daughter, even during the hours the two are separated: the quilt on the girl's bed extends across the book's gutter to form the checkered floor that her father sweeps while she slumbers. In the morning, her father returns in time for her to read him a story and tuck him in, and, in a final poignant vignette, Iwai shows the father's view from the window as he gazes down on his daughter, strolling down the sidewalk with her mother.

He could not rest until he had seen it all - and then he wanted others to see it, to enjoy it, and to be inspired by it as he had been. So he made notes of practical directions to the John Muir Trail, a high-country trail that runs from Mount Whitney to Yosemite National Park. Although Starr did not live to take part in the final preparation of his guidebook, so thoroughly was his work done that it was possible to publish it very nearly in the form that he had planned. The preparation was done by his father, Walter Starr, who also was well acquainted with High Sierra trails.<br>In the introduction to his book, Walter Starr, Jr., wrote: "By joining the United States Geological Survey maps of the region from Yosemite National Park to the headwaters of the Kern - a distance of more than one hundred and fifty miles - one will observe a continuous strip of blue lakes running down the map immediately west of the Sierra Crest. Through the heart of this blue strip winds the famous John Muir trail with laterals leading to it from the east and west, some of them vying with the Muir Trail itself in scenic grandeur."<br>Acting on the suggestion contained in these lines of his son, Walter Starr had a map made for the book showing the trails and approaches the author so well describes.<br>This classic guide covers:<br>Keys to trail descriptions and map references <br>How to obtain a wilderness permit <br>Yosemite National Park Region <br>Middle Fork of San Joaquin River Region <br>South Fork of San Joaquin River Region <br>North, Middle, and South Fork of Kings River Region <br>Sequoia National Park Region</p><p>tile and reliable, these pocket-sized guides are real wilderness experts.

How did this happen? According to Air America radio host Thom Hartmann, the apologists of the Right have become masters of the subtle and largely subconscious aspects of political communication. It&#39;s not an escalation in Iraq, it&#39;s a surge; it&#39;s not the inheritance tax, it&#39;s the death tax; it&#39;s not drilling for oil, it&#39;s exploring for energy. Conservatives didn&#39;t intuit the path to persuasive messaging; they learned these techniques. There is no reason why progressives can&#39;t learn them too. In Cracking the Code, Hartmann shows you how. Drawing on his background as a psychotherapist and advertising executive as well as a national radio host, he breaks down the structure for effective communication, sharing exercises and examples for practical application.</p><p><b>The Art and Science of Political Persuasion</b> <p>Too many Americans are acting against their best interests, buying into a right-wing line whose practical effect is to leave them marginalized and struggling. Why are the representatives the Right able to make their message so appealing? Because they've learned the techniques of effective communication--and you can too. Drawing on his rich background as a psychotherapist and advertising executive as well as a nationally syndicated Air America radio host, Thom Hartmann tells how to communicate the progressive message in a compelling and persuasive way. He explains what science has learned about how people actually perceive information and shows how to use this knowledge to truly connect with people. <i>Cracking the Code</i> gives you the tools you need to refute right-wing propaganda and reclaim America as a nation of We the People. </p><p>"No one communicates more thoughtfully or effectively on the radio airwaves than Thom Hartmann. He gets inside the arguments and helps people to think them through--to understand how to respond when they're talking about public issues with coworkers, neighbors, and friends. This book explores some of the key perspectives behind his approach, teaching us not just how to find the facts, but to talk about what they mean in a way that people will hear."<br> --Paul Loeb, author of<i> Soul of a Citizen</i> </p><p>"Thom Hartmann's book is an excellent primer in communication techniques. But unlike other message makers, Hartmann has genuine substance. He is restoring the radical populist tradition to the mainstream of our culture. Much of what we revere as Americans, Hartmann believes, was created by radicals who simply were ahead of their time."<br> -- Tom Hayden </p><p>"Thom Hartmann ought to be bronzed. His new book sets off from the same high plane as the last and offers explicit tools and how-to advice that will allow you to see, hear, and feel propaganda when it's directed at you and use the same techniques to refute it. His book would make a deaf-mute a better communicator. I want him on my reading table every day, and if you try one of his books, so will you."<br> --Peter Coyote, actor and author of <i>Sleeping Where I Fall</i> "In Cracking the Code, Thom Hartmann, America's most popular, informed, and articulate progressive talk show host and political analyst, tells us what makes humans vulnerable to unscrupulous propagandists and what we can do about it. It is essential reading for all Americans who are fed up with right-wing extremists manipulating our minds and politics to promote agendas contrary to our core values and interests." <br>--David C. Korten, author of The Great Turning: From Empire to Earth Community and When Corporations Rule the World and board chair of YES! magazine</p>As you read deeply in this book, you'll see things you hadn't realized were there--in everything from advertising to political rants. You'll learn the three ways people absorb information and how to appeal to each to get your message across, the kinds of words to use when trying to sway people and the kinds to avoid. why politics is all about stories and how knowing what those stories are will help you understand and connect with your audience, and much more. <p>Whether you're a politician, an activist, a volunteer, or a concerned citizen, you'll develop a strong sense for how to reach into that part of the collective human psyche where we truly do have the power to create a new world.</p></p><h2>Rich Dad, Poor Dad for Teens: The Secrets About Money--that You Don&#39;t Learn in School!

Beset by delays, the men paddled past their intended route, the Naskaupi River, and headed up the treacherous Susan River instead. When in early September they finally glimpsed the vast waters of Michikamau from the top of an unknown mountain, Labrador&#x2019;s cold winds had begun.

Duck hops off``These are the feet that jump the Duck down/into the muck all yucky and brown''and finds his vehicle stuck fast. Through illustrations that are so welcoming readers will want to crawl right into the artwork, Alborough then introduces Frog and Sheep and Goat, who yeomanly lend a hand.

Concluded in 1933, this controversial pact transferred 55,000 Jews and $100 million to Palestine on the condition that Zionist organizations call a halt to their economic boycott of Nazi Germany -- a potent tactic that was threatening to topple Hitler&#39;s government, then only in its first year in power. The debate over this controversial deal virtually tore apart the Jewish world in the pre-World War II era, and it remains unresolved today. Whereas the transfer agreement indeed ultimately saved lives, rescued assets, and helped lay the foundation for what would become the Jewish state in 1948, it also -- arguably -- allowed the Nazi regime to survive its first year and, over the next twelve, to plumb the depths of ethnic intolerance and implement massive genocide. With the world today confronting such morally complex issues as the compensation for slave labor during the Holocaust and the refusal of Swiss banks to return Jewish assets to their rightful heirs, the transfer agreement and the boycott that preceded it stand out even more startlingly as early examples of Jewish initiatives against Nazi terror. However ambiguous the choices made by the Jewish leaders in the turbulent prewar 1930s, they stand in a new and different light today. The Transfer Agreement is a remarkable and revelatory book that has now found its time.</p><p>Edwin Black is the award-winning, New York Times and international investigative author of 80 bestselling editions in 14 languages in 61 countries, as well as scores of newspaper and magazine articles in the leading publications of the United States, Europe and Israel.

The year preceding that moment was filled with shocking revelations and bizarre events, full of power politics, legal jujitsu, and high-stakes showdowns, and with head-shaking surprises every day.

He recounts Nixon&#x2019;s claims of executive privilege to withhold White House tape recordings of Oval Office conversations; the bribery scandal that led to the resignation of Vice President Spiro Agnew and his replacement by Gerald Ford; the firing of Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox; how in the midst of Watergate Nixon organized emergency military relief for Israel during the Yom Kippur War; the unanimous decision of the Supreme Court that required Nixon to turn over the tapes; and other insider moments from this important and dramatic period.<br> <i> <br>The Fall of Richard Nixon</i> allows readers to experience this American epic from the perspective of a journalist on the ground and at the center of it all.<br><br><b>Advance praise for <i>The Fall of Richard Nixon</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;A divided nation.

By all expectations, 1973 should have been the beginning of a glorious conclusion to the public life of Richard Milhous Nixon, the poor boy from Southern California who fought his way into the highest offices in America with a brilliant mind, a deep dark streak, and a personality constantly in conflict with the demands of his calling.<br><br>He began the year triumphantly, starting to wind down the unpopular Vietnam War as he launched a second term as president with nearly 61 percent of the American electorate having voted for him, a victory for this durable, familiar, and yet enigmatic son of Quaker parents. He had crushed the liberal establishment.<br><br>What could go wrong?<br><br>It had already gone wrong back in the summer of 1972, when a bumbling gang of burglars working for the Nixon reelection campaign were caught in a clumsy attempt to rifle through files at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate Hotel.<br><br>Two gifted rookie reporters from The Washington Post, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, were assigned to look into the burglary, and as they began to unravel the details, it became clear that this was no ordinary breaking and entering. Piece by piece, they constructed a case that traced the break-in from low-level Nixon acolytes to the highest levels of President Nixon&#x2019;s staff. Nixon&#x2019;s closest advisers, cabinet members, and fundraisers were already enmeshed in a spreading scandal that went beyond that botched burglary.<br><br>It would forever be known simply as Watergate: the web of lies, payoffs, and toxic tape recordings, followed, finally, by the first resignation of an American president. All of it demanded closer examination.<br><br>To this day, the essential question defies a rational answer: Why did the president&#x2019;s men organize a nighttime invasion of the Democratic Party headquarters when they were so far ahead of George McGovern in all the polls?<br><br>Later we learned that during his first term, Nixon had made a shady deal with milk producers, supporting higher prices in exchange for campaign contributions. Also, Nixon&#x2019;s fundraisers had blatantly violated new laws designed to provide transparency to campaign contributions. Other Nixon acolytes had written phony letters maligning the character of prominent Democrats.<br><br>Nonetheless, Nixon had survived massive demonstrations against his Vietnam policies in his first term, polls showed strong support for the law-and-order tenor of his campaign, his opening to China was widely praised, and the United States and the Soviet Union were negotiating new limits on nuclear weapons.<br><br>All the indicators showed Nixon was poised to crush McGovern.<br><br>The most tantalizing questions, however, remained: What was President Nixon&#x2019;s role, if any, in the burglary? And were there other dirty tricks yet to be exposed?<br><br>The reporting of Woodward and Bernstein continued to raise questions about the involvement of Nixon aides in the nefarious activities, and that went unnoticed by neither the feisty federal judge, John Sirica, who presided over the initial Watergate trials, nor the Democratic majority in the U.S. Senate.<br><br>Partly as a result of Sirica&#x2019;s warning that not all the facts had been revealed, the Senate voted unanimously on February 7, 1973, to establish a special committee to investigate Watergate. It was led by Senator Sam Ervin of North Carolina, the very model of a folksy, shrewd, good ol&#x2019; boy southern lawyer. His Senate Republican counterpart was another southerner, the equally shrewd and likable Howard Baker of Tennessee.<br><br>In April 1973, Nixon reluctantly dismissed two of his closest aides, H. R. &#x201c;Bob&#x201d; Haldeman and John Ehrlichman; they would soon perjure themselves before the Senate committee by denying their roles in the break-in cover-up. White House counsel John Dean was fired as well, after describing to the Senate investigators what the president knew about the burglary, saying the president was in the room on thirty-five occasions when the Watergate break-in was discussed.<br><br>The Senate committee hearings started in May 1973 and quickly became must-see TV for the nation as the cast of once-powerful White House aides struggled to explain how and why the White House, the very symbol of American strength and prestige, could have been involved in such a tawdry enterprise.<br><br>Daytime television audiences watching the Senate Watergate Committee during the summer of 1973 were riveted by the country-judge charm of Chairman Sam Ervin and by Howard Baker, who asked, &#x201c;What did the president know and when did he know it?&#x201d; While the president was trying to wind down the Vietnam War, strike up a new relationship with the Soviet Union, and capitalize on his historic opening to China, his closest aides were being questioned on Capitol Hill by the Senate committee, igniting time bombs on his future.<br><br>One presidential aide, Alexander Butterfield, was called to describe how the White House offices were organized, and he disclosed the unexpected news that an elaborate taping system had been installed to capture historic moments for future archives. It also recorded presidential conversations on subjects Nixon and his advisers presumably didn&#x2019;t expect to become whatever metaphor you like&#x2014;smoking gun, noose, trapdoor. The recordings quickly became the prize in the investigation. Sam Ervin and his fellow senators were determined to get them.<br><br>So were Attorney General Elliot Richardson and the special prosecutor Richardson had brought on board, Archibald Cox, both Harvard men, the kind Nixon privately detested. They had been appointed as the scandal was heating up.<br><br>John Mitchell, Nixon&#x2019;s former law partner and original attorney general, portrayed himself as Mr. Law and Order, but when he moved over to chair the President&#x2019;s reelection campaign he became deeply involved in the Watergate cover-up. He knew about the burglaries and approved of efforts to get the CIA involved as a cover, claiming national security. Eventually Mitchell was convicted of perjury, obstruction of justice, and conspiracy.<br><br>Richard Kleindienst, Mitchell&#x2019;s successor at Justice, had failed to tell authorities about President Nixon&#x2019;s order to ignore an antitrust investigation of the manufacturing conglomerate ITT when Kleindienst was an assistant AG. Later, after Kleindienst had been elevated to attorney general, he refused a request from G. Gordon Liddy to intervene in the Watergate investigation to protect CREEP, the President&#x2019;s reelection campaign, which was deeply involved in the break-in. Kleindienst resigned as attorney general and returned to his home state of Arizona to resume his law practice. His replacement was Elliot Richardson, who would come to play a major role in the President&#x2019;s demise.<br><br>By August 1973, several of Nixon&#x2019;s top advisers had lied their way into certain jail time. The bungled Watergate break-in was symptomatic of a larger criminal conspiracy run out of the White House, the aim of which was to crush political enemies.<br><br>The fabric of the presidency was unraveling, and constitutional law was under assault. That we&#x2019;ve known for some time. What is worth examining again, in light of today&#x2019;s political climate, are the day-to-day developments, decisions, and delusions, as well as the actions of the president, that led to the historic disgrace of the man who came so far and fell so hard.<br><br>On August 15, 1973, the president took his case to the American people. He opened his speech with a note of contrition, saying that because the abuses had taken place in his administration he accepted &#x201c;full responsibility&#x201d; and the right of the Senate committee to investigate the charges. His most emphatic statement was in his defense:<br><br>I state again to every one of you listening tonight these facts&#x2014;I had no prior knowledge of the Watergate break-in. I neither took part in nor knew about any of the subsequent cover-up activities. I neither authorized nor encouraged subordinates to engage in illegal or improper campaign tactics.<br><br>That was and that is the simple truth.<br><br>We now know that if there had been an electronic truth meter in the studio at the time, sirens would have been wailing, horns honking, lights flashing, and an offscreen voice bellowing, &#x201c;Are you kidding?&#x201d;<br><br>The president went on to describe what he insisted were his many efforts to uncover the facts about the break-in, and then got to the heart of his speech: the right of a president to protect confidential conversations and memoranda.<br><br>His speech was designed to advance the case for presidential authority and to proclaim his innocence, arguments that would be central to his defense for the next year. He argued on national television that the Oval Office tapes were &#x201c;privileged.&#x201d; In doing so, he invoked, without using the term, the concept of executive privilege, which is reserved for the chief executive of the United States; the concept has evolved with the presidency, and is designed to protect the executive branch from raids, subpoenas, and other interventions by the legislative or judicial branch.</p><h2>Franco: A Biography</h2><p>Shipped from UK, please allow 10 to 21 business days for arrival.

He is regarded as the leading historian of twentieth-century Spain alive.A definitive but dull biography of the least known of Europe's 20th-century dictators. Preston (International History/London School of Economics) makes some significant changes in the generally received portrait of Franco that has come down to us. He portrays Franco as admired by his troops in Spanish Morocco, where he spent ten of his early military years, for his thoroughness and his insistence on always leading assaults personally. In the Spanish Civil War itself, however, he was prodigal with his soldiers' lives, as he deliberately waged a war of attrition designed to kill as many enemy soldiers as possible rather than to win quick victories. Preston believes that the ruthlessness and exemplary use of terror Franco learned in Africa dominated both his political and military conduct. His ferocity in getting rid of rivals was exceeded only by his executions of tens of thousands of Republican supporters during and after the war (he would sign sheaves of execution notices while in his car, without reading the details). Preston's most interesting new material derives from his analysis of Franco's relationship with Hitler and Mussolini. Admirers of Franco have seized on Churchill's praise of the Spaniard for not joining the Axis powers in 1940, despite the aid he had received from Germany and Italy during the Civil War. In truth, Preston shows, Franco was eager to get into the war, particularly when he thought that the Germans were winning, but only if he received economic aid. It was Hitler's reluctance or inability to pay Franco's price, rather than Franco's shrewdness, that scuttled negotiations. Although Preston omits some of the context in which Franco operated--notably the atrocities committed by the Republican forces opposing him--Franco emerges as an extraordinarily unlovable figure, cunning, with a hunger for adulation and an icy cruelty. Careful and thorough, if uninspired, and likely to remain the standard biography in English for some time to come. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Now Jack is a retired Los Angeles homicide detective living in the nearly nonesistent hamlet of Tamarack, Wisconsin. He has no recolleciton of his adventures in the Territories, and was compelled to leave the police force when an odd, happenstance event threatened to awaken those memories. When a series of gruesome murders occur in western Wisconsin that are reminiscent of those committed several decades ago by a madman named Albert Fish, the killer is dubbed &#34;the Fisherman&#34; and Jack&#39;s buddy, the local chief of police, begs Jack to help the inexperience force find him. But are the new killings merely the work of a distrubed individual, or has a mysterious and malignant force been unleashed in this quiet town? What causes Jack&#39;s inexplicable waking dreams-if that is what they are-of robins&#39; eggs and red feathers? It&#39;s almost as if someone is trying to tell him something. As this cryptic message becomes increasingly impossible to ignore. Jack is drawn back to the Territories and to his own hidden past, where he may find the soul-strength to enter a terrifying house at the end of a deserted tract of forest, there to encounter the obsene and ferocious evils sheltered within it.</p><p>In the seemingly paradisal Wisconsin town of French Landing, small distortions disturb the beauty: a talking crow, an old man obeying strange internal marching orders, a house that is both there and not quite there. And roaming the town is a terrible fiend nicknamed the Fisherman, who is abducting and murdering small children and eating their flesh. The sheriff desperately wants the help of a retired Los Angeles cop, who once collared another serial killer in a neighboring town.<p> Of course, this is no ordinary policeman, but Jack Sawyer, hero of Stephen King and Peter Straub's 1984 fantasy <i>The Talisman</i>. At the end of that book, the 13-year-old Jack had completed a grueling journey through an alternate realm called the Territories, found a mysterious talisman, killed a terrible enemy, and saved the life of his mother and her counterpart in the Territories. Now in his 30s, Jack remembers nothing of the Talisman, but he also hasn't entirely forgotten: </p><blockquote>When these faces rise or those voices mutter, he has until now told himself the old lie, that once there was a frightened boy who caught his mother's neurotic terror like a cold and made up a story, a grand fantasy with good old Mom-saving Jack Sawyer at its center. None of it was real, and it was forgotten by the time he was sixteen. By then he was calm. Just as he's calm now, running across his north field like a lunatic, leaving that dark track and those clouds of startled moths behind him, but doing it <i>calmly</i>.</blockquote> Jack is abruptly pulled into the case--and back into the Territories--by the Fisherman himself, who sends Jack a child's shoe, foot still attached. As Jack flips back and forth between French Landing and the Territories, aided by his 20-years-forgotten friend Speedy Parker and a host of other oddballs (including a blind disk jockey, the beautiful mother of one of the missing children, and a motorcycle gang calling itself the "Hegelian Scum"), he tracks both the Fisherman and a much bigger fish: the <i>abbalah</i>, the Crimson King who seeks to destroy the axle of worlds. <p> While <i>The Talisman</i> was a straightforward myth in 1980s packaging, <i>Black House</i> is richer and more complex, a fantasy wrapped in a horror story inside a mystery, sporting a clever tangle of references to Charles Dickens, Edgar Allan Poe, jazz, baseball, and King's own Dark Tower saga. <i>Talisman</i> fans will find the sure-footed Jack has worn well--as has the King/Straub writing style, which is much improved with the passage of two decades. <i>--Barrie Trinkle</i></p>Read by<br>15 cassettes/approx. 23 hours<br><br>The long-awaited sequel to the #1 bestseller <i>The Talisman</i>, to be published on September 15, 2001, the twentieth anniversary of the day <i>The Talisman </i>begins.<br><br>Twenty years ago, a boy named Jack Sawyer traveled to a parallel universe called the Territories to save his mother and her Territories "twinner" from a premature and agonizing death that would have brought cataclysm to the other world.

To achieve such precision simply by reporting what happened and what was said, one must have a rare clarity of vision."&#x2014;William Burroughs, from the introduction to <i>Genet in Tangier</i></p><p>Tangier, "the most extraordinary and mysterious city in the world," according to Mohamed Choukri, was a haven for many Western writers in the early twentieth century. Paul Bowles, Jean Genet, and Tennessee Williams all spent time there, and each was in turn befriended by Choukri.</p><p>Collected here in one volume, for the first time in English, are his delightful recollections of these encounters, offering a truly fresh and unpretentious insight into the lives of these cult figures. Includes an afterword by Choukri previously published only in French.</p><p><i>As we walked, I showed Tennessee the Arabic translation of his play, and explained that the title in Arabic meant: A cat on the fire. I added that several of his plays, both full-length and one-acters, had been published in Arabic, as well as some of his short stories. I heard his noisy laugh for the first time. Many books, many boys!</i></p><p><b>Mohamed Choukri</b> (1935&#x2013;2003) is one of North Africa's most controversial and widely read authors.

After a childhood of poverty and petty crime, Choukri learned how to read and write at the age of twenty. He then became a teacher and writer, finally being awarded the chair of Arabic Literature at Ibn Batuta College in Tangier. His works include For Bread Alone and Streetwise.Choukri, who grew up illiterate before becoming one of Morocco's seminal writers, shares three distinctive portraits with progressive degrees of intimacy. Genet is often observed from a distance or recollected in short bits of passing conversation and these reprinted journal entries speak most to Choukri's own aspirations of becoming a writer. Williams's stint in Tangier in 1973 included countless languid caf� afternoons and dinner parties; the two writers were friends and these amicable passages provide satisfying windows of "real" life for a literary figure as mythic as Williams. But it is Bowles (who translated the first two sections of this book as well as Choukri's For Bread Alone) who comes most to life with depth and honesty in a portrait that is not always flattering (it is here too that the city of Tangiers becomes another vibrant character): "Paul Bowles loves Morocco, but does not really like Moroccans," Choukri reflects. Though it is clear from their years together that Bowles did indeed like Choukri; the tenderness with which they both age has less to do the veneer of fame than of men aware of their own mortality.

To cheer him up, Paul&#x2019;s editor, Gloria, encourages him to finish his latest cookbook on-site in Tuscany, hoping that a change of scenery (plus the occasional truffled pasta and glass of red wine) will offer a cure for both heartache and writer&#x2019;s block.

He lives in Scotland.<b>2</b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> <b><i>THERE IS NO CAR</i></b><br>&nbsp;<br>Scotland fell away beneath him, a stretch of green pasture, of hills, of swirling mist. Suddenly they were bathed in sunlight; fields of cloud, topped with crenellations of white, now lay beneath them as their plane pointed south. In his window seat he closed his eyes against the glare, imagining for a few moments their destination, as much an idea, a feeling, as a place. He saw a small tower that he had never seen before, a tower of warm red brick with a pattern of holes for doves. Down below, a man was pulling at a bell rope; as the bell rang, the doves launched themselves from their holes in the brick and fluttered skywards.<br>&nbsp;<br>He opened his eyes and noticed that the passenger in the seat beside him, a man in perhaps his early fifties, dressed in a lightweight linen suit, was looking at him. The man smiled at him, and he returned the smile.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What takes you to Pisa?&#x201d; the man asked. His accent revealed him as Italian.<br>&nbsp;<br>Paul hesitated, unsure as to whether he wanted to strike up a conversation that went beyond the niceties. He had brought with him a book that was just beginning to engage him, and he was looking forward to getting back to it. But the man smiled at him again, and his natural politeness decided the matter.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br> <i>&#x201c;So parlare Italiano,&#x201d; </i>he began. <i>&#x201c;Sono . . .&#x201d;</i><br>&nbsp;<br>The man did not allow him to finish. &#x201c;Ah!&#x201d; he said, and then, continuing in Italian, &#x201c;What a pleasure it is for us Italians to discover somebody who speaks our language.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure there are many. Such a beautiful language . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes, but what use is a beautiful language spoken just by oneself? It&#x2019;s all very well for the Spaniards, because there are so many Spanish speakers&#x2014;all over the world. Even Portuguese has Brazil, but we have just us&#x2014;just Italy&#x2014;and after a while we get fed up with speaking only to ourselves. We have heard everything there is to say in Italian.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Surely not . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I am not entirely serious. A bit serious, perhaps, but not entirely.&#x201d; Turning in his seat, he extended a hand towards Paul. &#x201c;But I must introduce myself. I am Rossi&#x2014;Silvio Rossi.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Paul Stuart.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Silvio loosened his tie. &#x201c;Stuart is the name of Scottish kings, is it not? Mary Stuart . . .&#x201d; He made a chopping gesture across his throat. &#x201c;She was most unfortunate. Queens cannot choose their neighbours, and if they find they have one who has an axe, then it is most regrettable.&#x201d; He sighed, as if the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, had been a recent outrage.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It was a long time ago,&#x201d; Paul said.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Silvio raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;But I am an historian,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;What happened in the past remains rather vivid for me and . . .&#x201d; He paused, and now removed the tie altogether. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s better. Yes I find that the past has a much bigger shadow than people believe. It&#x2019;s still with us in so many ways. At our side all the time, whispering into our ear.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Warning us not to repeat our mistakes?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Silvio smiled. &#x201c;We repeat some. Others we&#x2019;re sensible&nbsp;enough to avoid making more than once. But that&#x2019;s not what I was thinking about. What I was thinking about was the way in which the past determines our character, not just as individuals, but as nations. A child who is treated badly grows up damaged. A people who are subjected to bad treatment will bear resentments, will be suspicious. They will be bad allies.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Paul, who had been holding his book, slipped it into the seat pocket in front of him. He had endured worse conversations on flights, including an attempt at religious conversion, a confession of adultery, and detailed advice on the attractions of Panama as a tax shelter. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re thinking of?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Silvio waved a hand airily. &#x201c;Oh, there are many examples. Russia, for one. Russia is a peasant country. It has a past of serfdom that ended only in the nineteenth century. That made for a vast, stubborn, ignorant population&#x2014;one that was also very resentful. And they are resentful today&#x2014;particularly of the West.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I see.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;They view the West in the same light as they viewed their feudal masters. Authority.&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;So western politicians who lecture Russians about human rights or their tendency to invade their neighbours will never change them. Not one bit. You&#x2019;re dealing with a particular sort of bear, you see. One with a history. An abused bear with a short temper.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Paul savoured the metaphor. He was right. &#x201c;And Italy?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s an interesting case. With us, the important thing to remember is that we are very young. We have lots of history, of course, but Italy itself is a teenager. The Risorgimento was really just yesterday, you&#x2019;ll know. It ended in 1871. That&#x2019;s yesterday. And that means that, as a state, we are still very far from maturity. That&#x2019;s why half the population doesn&#x2019;t really believe that the Italian state exists&#x2014;or, if it&nbsp;does, they feel that they owe it nothing. We&#x2019;re very disloyal to Rome, you know. We look after ourselves&#x2014;our family, our city&#x2014;and we don&#x2019;t like paying taxes to Rome.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Nobody likes taxes.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Some like them less than others. Take the Greeks. They have a particular aversion to taxes, and this is because they haven&#x2019;t forgotten that they were once part of the Ottoman Empire and they saw no reason to pay taxes to the Ottomans.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;re saying that people don&#x2019;t change?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Silvio sighed. &#x201c;They don&#x2019;t. Or if they do, it takes a long time. A very long time.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The plane gave a slight jolt as it encountered a pocket of turbulent air. Paul glanced out of the window, and then returned to the conversation. &#x201c;May I ask you something?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Is this what you actually do?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Silvio shook his head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m an economic historian,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s something quite different, but it doesn&#x2019;t stop me having views on these more general matters.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Economic history,&#x201d; muttered Paul.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;A sobering science. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;ve been in Scotland. I&#x2019;ve been at a conference.&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t tell me why you&#x2019;re going to Pisa.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;To taste food and wine,&#x201d; said Paul.<br>&nbsp;<br>Silvio looked surprised. &#x201c;So that&#x2019;s what you do?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes. I write about it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;There is a great deal to be said about Italian food.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;m discovering that.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Paul reached for his book.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I mustn&#x2019;t keep you from your reading.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Paul had not intended to be rude. &#x201c;Forgive me. I was enjoying our conversation.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;But you must read your book, and I have some papers to&nbsp;attend to.&#x201d; Silvio reached into his pocket. &#x201c;Let me give you my card. I&#x2019;m at the University of Pisa. It has all the details there. If you need help while you&#x2019;re in Italy, please get in touch with me. My door is always open.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Paul thanked him and took the card. Professor Silvio Rossi, it appeared, was not only Professor of Economic History at the University of Pisa, but a member of the Italian Academy of Economic Science and a <i>cavaliere </i>of the Republic. He slipped the card into the pocket of his jacket and opened his book.<br><br>###<br><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Chant: The Origins, Form, Practice, and Healing Power of Gregorian Chant</h2><p>Since the spring of 1994 there have been sales of almost two million copies of the Angel recording of Chant, sung by the Benedictine monks of Santo Domingo de Silos in Spain. People are drawn irresistibly to its peaceful sound, but very few of them know anything about the tradition or meaning of Gregorian Chant or understand the language in which it is sung. In this companion book, which includes the full text of the Chant CD with translations from the Latin, Katharine Le Mee traces the historical and liturgical sources of the chant and provides answers to everyone's questions about what Gregorian Chant is, how it is written and sung, the latest research on its therapeutic qualities, and the extraordinary effect its simple, pure, unaccompanied tones can have on the body, mind, and heart.<br><br>At a time when we are all feeling so overworked and under pressure, the calm, measured, almost transcendent sound of the monks singing these ancient melodies seems to put us in touch with our true selves. It is as though, in listening to their song, we share in the monks' aspirations, devotion, and experience. The sudden popularity of this music today -- after 1,300 years -- is indicative of the deep spiritual hunger manifesting everywhere. Here is a book that explains how and in what ways Gregorian Chant can begin to nourish us and transform our lives.</p><p>"Gregorian Chant has suddenly become America's newest pop-music phenomenon."<p>Time</p><p>"What we're talking about is inner peace, transcendence, a serenity, beyond mortal care. For a generation that frowns on organized religious movements (or organized anything), this is, without a doubt, the new soul music."</p><p>The San Francisco Examiner</p><p>"Not since the Singing Nun went gold in 1963 has there been such a clerical chartbuster as Chant."</p><p>People</p><p>"Gregorian Chant is the original mystical minimalism .... In addition to comprising glorious sounds, pure and simple, it represents the beginning of Western music as it has come down to us."</p><p>The New York Times</p><p>"Gregorian Chant is ... intensely, ecstatically contemplative."</p><p>The Washington Post</p>The album Chant, recorded by the Benedictine monks of the small Spanish monastery, Santo Domingo de Silos, is one of the biggest recording hits of the year., . Here, to accompany and explain the phenomenon of such worldwide appreciation of the medieval music, recording artist Le Mee discusses Gregorian chant itself and suggests some astute, if unproven, theories about why this music is so compelling; about why this previously esoteric form of devotional music has so taken the Western world by storm; and about what there is about the present historical moment that has made this recording by little-known monks so powerful and so accessible. Perhaps more significantly, she gives us some fascinating tools by which to fashion our own answers to these questions, as well as an important resource for listeners curious about this extraordinary music.

The mornings were foggy, the afternoons chill. With the snowdrifts of winter almost all melted, the land around Machi became a soupy mud whose only virtue was the spring crop of wheat and snow peas it would bring forth. Travel was harder now even than in the deadly cold of deep winter.<br>And still, the travelers came.<br>&#x201c;With all respect, this exercise, as you call it, is ill-advised,&#x201d; the envoy said. His hands still held a pose of deference though the conversation had long since parted from civility. &#x201c;I am sure your intentions are entirely honorable, however it is the place of the Dai-kvo&#x2014;&#x201c;<br>&#x201c;If the Dai-kvo wants to rule Machi, tell him to come north,&#x201d; the Khai Machi snapped. &#x201c;He can pull my puppet strings from the next room. I&#x2019;ll make a bed for him.&#x201d;<br>The envoy&#x2019;s eyes went wide. He was a young man, and hadn&#x2019;t mastered the art of keeping his mind from showing on his face. Otah, the Khai Machi, waved away his own words and sighed. He had gone too far, and he knew it. Another few steps and they&#x2019;d be pointing at each other and yelling about which of them wanted to create the Third Empire. The truth was that he had ruled Machi these last fourteen years only by necessity. The prospect of uniting the cities of the Khaiem under his rule was about as enticing as scraping his skin off with a rock.<br>The audience was a private one, in a small room lined with richly carved blackwood, lit by candles that smelled like rich earth and vanilla, and set well away from the corridors and open gardens where servants and members of the utkhaiem might unintentionally overhear them. This wasn&#x2019;t business he cared to have shared over the dances and dinners of the court. Otah rose from his chair and walked to the window, forcing his temper back down. He opened the shutters, and the city stretched out before him, grand towers of stone stretching up toward the sky, and beyond them the wide plain to the south, green with the first crops of the spring. He pressed his frustration back into yoke.<br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean that,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I know that the Dai-kvo doesn&#x2019;t intend to dictate to me. Or any of the Khaiem. I appreciate your concern, but the creation of the guard isn&#x2019;t a threat. It&#x2019;s hardly an army, you know. A few hundred men trained up to maybe half the level of a Westlands garrison could hardly topple the world.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We are concerned for the stability of all the cities,&#x201d; the envoy said.&nbsp; &#x201c;When one of the Khaiem begins to study war, it puts all the others on edge.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s hardly studying war to hand a few men knives and remind them which end&#x2019;s the handle.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s more than any of the Khaiem have done in the past hundred years. And you must see that you haven&#x2019;t made it your policy to ally yourself with . . . well, with anyone.&#x201d;<br>Well, this is going just as poorly as I expected, Otah thought.<br>&#x201c;I have a wife, thank you,&#x201d; Otah said, his manner cool. But the envoy had clearly reached the end of his patience. Hearing him stand, Otah turned. The young man&#x2019;s face was flushed, his hands folded into the sleeves of his brown poet&#x2019;s robes.<br>&#x201c;And if you were a shopkeeper, having a single woman would be admirable,&#x201d; the envoy said. &#x201c;But as the Khai Machi, turning away every woman who&#x2019;s offered to you is a pattern of insult. I can&#x2019;t be the first one to point this out. From the time you took the chair, you&#x2019;ve isolated yourself from the rest of the Khaiem, the great houses of the utkhaiem, the merchant houses. Everyone.&#x201d;<br>Otah ran through the thousand arguments and responses&#x2014;the treaties and trade agreements, the acceptance of servants and slaves, all of the ways in which he&#x2019;d tried to bind himself and Machi to the other cities. They wouldn&#x2019;t convince the envoy or his master, the Dai-kvo. They wanted blood&#x2014;his blood flowing in the veins of some boy child whose mother had come from south or east or west. They wanted to know that the Khai Yalakeht or Pathai or Tan-Sadar might be able to hope for a grandson on the black chair in Machi once Otah had died. His wife Kiyan was past the age to bear another child, but men could get children on younger women. For one of the Khaiem to have only two children, and both by the same woman&#x2014;and her a wayhouse keeper from Udun . . . They wanted sons from him, fathered on women who embodied wise political alliances. They wanted to preserve tradition, and they had two empires and nine generations of the Khaiate court life to back them. Despair settled on him like a thick winter cloak.<br>There was nothing to be gained. He knew all the reasons for all the choices he had made, and he could as easily explain them to a mine dog as to this proud young man who&#x2019;d traveled weeks for the privilege of taking him to task. Otah sighed, turned, and took a deeply formal pose of apology.<br>&#x201c;I have distracted you from your task, Athai-cha. That was not my intention. What was it again the Dai-kvo wished of me?&#x201d;<br>The envoy pressed his lips bloodless. They both knew the answer to the question, but Otah&#x2019;s feigned ignorance would force him to restate it. And the simple fact that Otah&#x2019;s bed habits were not mentioned would make his point for him. Etiquette was a terrible game.<br>&#x201c;The militia you have formed,&#x201d; the envoy said. &#x201c;The Dai-kvo would know your intention in creating it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I intend to send it to the Westlands. I intend it to take contracts with whatever forces there are acting in the best interests of all the cities of the Khaiem. I will be pleased to draft a letter saying so.&#x201d;<br>Otah smiled. The young poet&#x2019;s eyes flickered. As insults went, this was mild enough. Eventually, the poet&#x2019;s hands rose in a pose of gratitude.<br>&#x201c;There is one other thing, Most High,&#x201d; the envoy said. &#x201c;If you take any aggressive act against the interests of another of the Khaiem, the Dai-kvo will recall Cehmai and Stone-Made-Soft. If you take arms against them, he will allow the Khaiem to use their poets against you and your city.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Otah said. &#x201c;I understood that when I heard you&#x2019;d come. I am not acting against the Khaiem, but thank you for your time, Athai-cha. I will have a letter sewn and sealed for you by morning.&#x201d;<br>After the envoy had left, Otah sank into a chair and pressed the heels of his hands to his temples. Around him, the palace was quiet. He counted fifty breaths, then rose again, closed and latched the door, and turned back to the apparently empty room.<br>&#x201c;Well?&#x201d; he asked, and one of the panels in the corner swung open, exposing a tiny hidden chamber brilliantly designed for eavesdropping.<br>The man who sat in the listener&#x2019;s chair seemed both at ease and out of place. At ease because it was Sinja&#x2019;s nature to take the world lightly, and out of place because his suntanned skin and rough, stained leathers made him seem like a gardener on a chair of deep red velvet and silver pins fit for the head of a merchant house or a member of the utkhaiem. He rose and closed the panel behind him.<br>&#x201c;He seems a decent man,&#x201d; Sinja said. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t want him on my side of a fight, though. Overconfident.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m hoping it won&#x2019;t come to that,&#x201d; Otah said.<br>&#x201c;For a man who&#x2019;s convinced the world he&#x2019;s bent on war, you&#x2019;re a bit squeamish about violence.&#x201d;<br>Otah chuckled.<br>&#x201c;I think sending the Dai-kvo his messenger&#x2019;s head might not be the most convincing argument for my commitment to peace,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;Excellent point,&#x201d; Sinja agreed as he poured himself a bowl of wine. &#x201c;But then you are training men to fight. It&#x2019;s a hard thing to preach peace and stability and also pay men to think what&#x2019;s the best way to disembowel someone with a spear.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I know it,&#x201d; Otah said, his voice dark as wet slate. &#x201c;Gods. You&#x2019;d think having total power over a city would give you more options, wouldn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br>Otah sipped the wine. It was rich and astringent and fragrant of late summer, and it swirled in the bowl like a dark river. He felt old. Fourteen years he&#x2019;d spent trying to be what Machi needed him to be&#x2014; steward, manager, ruler, half-god, fuel for the gossip and backbiting of the court. Most of the time, he did well enough, but then something<br>like this would happen, and he would be sure again that the work was beyond him.<br>&#x201c;You could disband it,&#x201d; Sinja said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not as though you need the extra trade.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not about getting more silver,&#x201d; Otah said.<br>&#x201c;Then what&#x2019;s it about? You aren&#x2019;t actually planning to invade Cetani, are you? Because I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s a good idea.&#x201d;<br>Otah coughed out a laugh.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s about being ready,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;Ready?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Every generation finds it harder to bind fresh andat. Every one that slips away becomes more difficult to capture. It can&#x2019;t go on forever. There will come a time that the poets fail, and we have to rely on something else.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; Sinja said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re starting a militia so that someday, generations from now, when so...<br></p><h2>The English Country House: An Art and a Way of Life</h2><p>Depicts the architecture and furnishings of houses dating from the fifteenth century and describes the events which affected their developing artistry and grandeur</p><p></p><h2>The Splintered Empires: The Eastern Front 1917&#x2013;21</h2><p><p>At the beginning of 1917, the three empires fighting on the Eastern Front were reaching their breaking points, but none was closer than Russia.

While some headed off in a lifeboat to seek help, 250 of the survivors ended up on a tiny coral island less than half a mile long. A band of mutineers, whose motives were almost beyond comprehension, then started on a cold-blooded killing spree, leaving fewer than 80 people alive when the rescue boat arrived three months later. BATAVIA&#39;S GRAVEYARD tells this strange story as a gripping narrative structured around three strong principal characters: Francisco Pelsaert, the cultivated but weak-willed captain; Jeronimus Cornelisz, a sinister apothecary with a terrifying personal philosophy influenced by Rosicrucianism who set himself up as the ruler of the island; and Wiebbe Hayes, the only survivor with the courage to fight Jeronimus&#39;s band.

Dash&#39;s version of their hair-raising tale sensibly eschews hysterical romanticism in favour of a springy, understated narrative that lets the horror speak for itself...

Not while a killer stalks the town and its hard-luck inhabitants. County prosecutor Bell Elkins and her closest friend, Sheriff Nick Fogelsong, are stymied by a murderer who seems to come and go like smoke on the mountain. At the same time, Bell must deal with the return from prison of her sister, Shirley&#x2015;who, like Bell, carries the indelible scars of a savage past.</p><p>In the third mystery chronicling the journey of Bell Elkins and her return to her Appalachian hometown, we also meet Lindy Crabtree&#x2015;a coal miner's daughter with dark secrets of her own, secrets that threaten to explode into even more violence. Acker's Gap is a place of loveliness and brutality, of isolation and fierce attachments&#x2015;a place where the dead rub shoulders with the living, and demand their due.<br>|<br>Julia Keller once again captivates readers with this story of a dying West Virginia mountain town and the strong, proud people who inhabit it.</p></p><p><p>JULIA KELLER spent twelve years as a reporter and editor for the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, where she won a Pulitzer Prize. A recipient of a Nieman Fellowship at Harvard University, she was born in West Viriginia and lives in Chicago and Ohio.</p><p>Chapter One</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The flat-roofed shack was situated along a country road sunk deep in summer darkness, the kind of darkness that comes after a day of brash sunlight and thus seems more intense and deliberate than ordinary nightfall. The lights in the small tavern made it look, by odd contrast with that shadow-blackened road, like a living thing, shimmying and caterwauling and ready to leap up and lurch away, leaving behind a shallow hole and the sullen stink of piss.</p> <p>Bell Elkins knew it was an illusion. She knew the only real motion came from the quivering lights in four porthole windows across the building&#x2019;s front and from the ugly thuds of the live band&#x2019;s bass beat, a percussion that hit like a fist on the heart. Yet she hesitated anyway, remaining for a few more minutes in her vehicle at the edge of the dirt-ridged parking lot. Other cars were stuck at crazy random angles, abandoned by their drivers with don&#x2019;t-give-a-damn nonchalance.</p> <p>It was 3:42 A.M. on a sticky-hot Saturday night&#x2014;no, Sunday morning&#x2014;in the middle of June, and Bell was angry. The anger moved across her mind like a wire being threaded slowly through her veins, millimeter by millimeter. It didn&#x2019;t flare, the way her anger usually behaved; this time, it was gradual. A steady, ominous rise. As she reminded herself of each galling fact, the anger ticked up a notch, and then a notch past that.</p> <p>Fact: Her sister Shirley hadn&#x2019;t been home in three days. Shirley was a grown woman, and the house rules were loose&#x2014;but still. Three days. And no call, no text.</p> <p>Fact: The cell on Bell&#x2019;s bedside table had played its perversely chipper tune just before 3 A.M. On the other end of the line was Amanda Sturm, a deputy sheriff in Collier County. &#x201c;Got a call &#x2019;bout a ruckus over at Tommy&#x2019;s,&#x201d; Sturm said after identifying herself. She didn&#x2019;t have to identify Tommy&#x2019;s. It was a bar&#x2014;this bar&#x2014;out along Burnt Ridge Road, a place notorious for fights and drugs and trouble. &#x201c;Looked in on things,&#x201d; the deputy went on, &#x201c;and got the lay of the land and then figured I oughta give you a call. Sorry &#x2019;bout the time.&#x201d;</p> <p>She hadn&#x2019;t awakened her; Bell hardly slept these days, and spent many of her nights sitting up in the battered old easy chair in her living room, reading or trying to. Tonight, she&#x2019;d actually made it upstairs to bed, but sleep was a nonstarter. Still, though, the call had startled her. &#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; Bell had asked. Her cell was as light and sleek as a Hershey Bar, yet she used both hands to wrangle it, one to secure it against her ear, the other to keep the bottom half tilted against her chin.</p> <p>There was a pause, and then the deputy said, &#x201c;Well, ma&#x2019;am, one of &#x2019;em says her sister is the Raythune County prosecutor and I better lay off. Checked her wallet and sure nuff&#x2014;you&#x2019;re listed as contact person. Shirley Dolan&#x2019;s her name.&#x201d;</p> <p>Fact: Commingling with the clientele in a place like Tommy&#x2019;s could put Shirley in real danger of violating her parole.</p> <p>Fact: Shirley was well aware of that. She also knew Bell was grappling with a terrible case, the brutal and apparently unprovoked murder of a retired coal miner two nights ago, right in the man&#x2019;s own driveway on the west side of Acker&#x2019;s Gap. The town was still reeling from the shock of it, from a crime that had injected a paralyzing chill into the warm, loose-limbed languor of summer in the mountains.</p> <p>Fact: Shirley didn&#x2019;t give a rat&#x2019;s ass. She didn&#x2019;t care what sort of extra hassle she caused for Bell, what kind of shame or embarrassment or inconvenience.</p> <p>Fact: Shirley was not only selfish; she was reckless, too. Dropping Bell&#x2019;s name to a deputy sheriff to garner special treatment was bad enough, but when you added the risk this posed to Shirley&#x2019;s fledgling status as a free woman&#x2014;well, the whole thing made Bell so incensed that she wrapped her hands even tighter around the steering wheel of her Ford Explorer, glad to have a way to channel her rage, a place to direct it temporarily.</p> <p>She&#x2019;d done everything she could do for Shirley. In the three months since her sister&#x2019;s return, Bell had given her a place to stay, bought her clothes, tolerated her smoking. And she&#x2019;d stayed out of her hair, letting Shirley make her own decisions&#x2014;and by &#x201c;decisions,&#x201d; Bell meant &#x201c;mistakes.&#x201d; The two words had become synonymous in her mind, when it came to Shirley.</p> <p>There&#x2019;d been trouble from the start. One night, Shirley fell asleep in a kitchen chair with a burning cigarette notched between two fingers, jerking awake just in time to avert disaster, and another, she came home drunk and surly, and when Bell tried to guide the weaving woman to a bed, Shirley shook off the helping hand, and the foul word that fell out of her mouth made Bell shudder in shock, as if Shirley had coughed up a toad or a spider.</p> <p>Such behavior confirmed her sister&#x2019;s lack of judgment, of manners, of respect, of&#x2014;well, maybe Sheriff Fogelsong had nailed it. &#x201c;Lack of gratitude,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d said to Bell when she confided her frustration about Shirley. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s really eating at you. You expect her to be grateful. Even humble. For sticking by her, for waiting, for taking her in. Plus&#x2014;ever held a cork underwater? And then let it go? Shoots up like a geyser. Way the hell up in the air.&#x201d;</p> <p>The sheriff, Bell quickly decided, had a point. &#x201c;Ever get tired,&#x201d; she had countered, &#x201c;of being right all the damned time?&#x201d;</p> <p>His reply: &#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m wrong on purpose every now and again, just to keep things interesting.&#x201d;</p> <p>The recollection of that encounter reminded Bell of how much she missed him&#x2014;and not just because she was staring straight in the face of an unsolved homicide that had left the town edgy and restive. Fogelsong had taken a month&#x2019;s leave of absence. He was scheduled to return in the coming week, at which point Pam Harrison would hand back over the top spot and resume her job as chief deputy&#x2014;but still. Even a short spell without him was too long for Bell. Nick Fogelsong knew her better than anyone else; he understood her right down to the ground, and she appreciated his perspective. Needed it, more to the point.</p> <p>Shirley, he&#x2019;d gently remind Bell when her irritation got in the way of sound thinking, was a forty-six-year-old woman who&#x2019;d never had a chance to be young. She&#x2019;d been in prison for three decades, and in that bleak and tightly regulated place, every step was monitored, every spontaneous impulse blocked.</p> <p>So Bell had cut her some slack. Backed off. Held her tongue.</p> <p>But tonight an entirely new threshold had been crossed. This was the first time Shirley had stayed away for several days running. Or used Bell&#x2019;s name in a scrape with the law. This was disturbingly fresh territory. And it came at a time when Bell ought to be focusing on public safety in general, not a misbehaving sister in particular. If Shirley was caught up in a sweep at Tommy&#x2019;s&#x2014;the bar&#x2019;s proprietor, Tommy LeSeur, was himself a convicted felon, having served four and a half years on a narcotics charge&#x2014;her parole could be revoked.</p> <p>&#x201c;Hey, pretty lady.&#x201d;</p> <p>At the same moment Bell heard the words, she smelled the hot oniony stink of the man who had suddenly thrust his face in the Explorer&#x2019;s open window. He&#x2019;d taken her by surprise, so intent was she on her thoughts as she stared at the run-down bar. But she wasn&#x2019;t frightened. She was pissed off. The man had a fat face, swollen to the point of resembling an allergic reaction. Bristles of beard stuck out from his round cheeks and from the undulating rolls of blubber that propped up his tiny chin. Booze, sweat, and the heavy fug of a recent bout of vomiting invaded her space.</p> <p>Before Bell could react, he was talking again. He&#x2019;d hooked his hands across the bottom of the window and hung on as if it were an upper-story sill.</p> <p>&#x201c;Lookin&#x2019; for somethun?&#x201d; he slurred. &#x201c;Or some<i>body</i>? Wanna party?&#x201d; A wicked leer seized his mouth, making both ends of it pointy. A pearl of sweat&#x2014;or maybe another liquid, although who&#x2019;d really want a positive ID?&#x2014;was poised on the bottom rim of a nostril. His eyes were bleary. &#x201c;How &#x2019;bout it, baby?&#x201d;</p> <p>First Bell wanted to laugh&#x2014;<i>Oh, yeah, here I come, you&#x2019;re freakin&#x2019; irresistible, mister</i>&#x2014;and then the anger roared back, this time mixed with revulsion.</p> <p>&#x201c;Get the hell away from me,&#x201d; she said. Low voice. Words measured and calm, but laced with threat. Only a fool would miss her meaning.</p> <p>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, baby. Don&#x2019;t be doin&#x2019; me like that,&#x201d; the intruder said. His oily wheedle&#x2014;delivered on the back of a gust of smelly breath&#x2014;was enough to make Bell&#x2019;s stomach turn.</p> <p>With a gesture so quick that it caught him in the middle of a wink, she flung open the car door. Knocked back, he teetered for a tenth of a second and then landed flat on his ample butt.</p> <p>Behind him, starkly visible in the glare of the crude spotlight rigged to a corner of the building, was a stumpy ring of three men&#x2014;his buddies, Bell assumed, because these types always traveled in packs. The men pointed at Fat Ass and stomped their work boots and laughed, a hard-edged, mirthless laughter that sounded like another variety of assault. They wore baseball caps and long-sleeved plaid flannel shirts with the cuffs buttoned and the shirttails flapping out behind them, even though this was the middle of summer; such, Bell knew, was the year-round uniform of the good ole boys, the kind you could find lining the back roads around here like lint on a comb.</p> <p>&#x201c;Bitch!&#x201d; Fat Ass yelled at her. He&#x2019;d yet to rise from his seat on the ground, thwarted by, in equal measures, obesity and drunkenness. &#x201c;Goddamned bitch.&#x201d;</p> <p>That only made his friends laugh harder. &#x201c;Looks like she up and tole you what she thinksa you,&#x201d; one of them opined, nudging Fat Ass with the toe of his boot, as if his buddy were a clump of dirt that needed relocating. The others re-upped their laughter, hooting like fools, slapping at their knees when they weren&#x2019;t using their fingers to point at Fat Ass. A gray scab of moon regarded the scene indifferently from above.</p> <p>Bell pondered her next move. Her mission was simple: Go in the bar, find Shirley, and somehow persuade her to come home. She wasn&#x2019;t looking for a fight. If these creeps kept it up, though, and interfered with her, she would handle it. Fat Ass didn&#x2019;t know what trouble was until he&#x2019;d tangled with the likes of her. Her seventeen-year-old daughter, Carla&#x2014;currently living with Bell&#x2019;s ex-husband, Sam, but due back in Acker&#x2019;s Gap for summer vacation in a week&#x2014;had put it best: &#x201c;Mom,&#x201d; Carla said, &#x201c;when you get mad, I think I&#x2019;d sorta rather deal with the guy in the <i>Texas Chain Saw Massacre</i> movies, you know?&#x201d;</p> <p>The bar&#x2019;s double doors flapped open. During the few seconds that the interior of the establishment was exposed&#x2014;the hot wild noise, the undulating red lights framed by the solid black night&#x2014;it looked, to Bell&#x2019;s eye, like a peephole into hell.</p> <p>A female deputy sheriff&#x2014;short, hatless, and heavyset&#x2014;came striding out of Tommy&#x2019;s, turning this way and that to cut a path between the parked cars. Her long gray hair was funneled into a twisty braid that perched on her shoulder like a pet. Black boots chopped at the gravel with each forceful step. Her gun was holstered on her wide hip, but she kept her big right hand in contact with the grip, a <i>Don&#x2019;t make me use this</i> set to her meaty jaw.</p> <p>The three men scattered like scrap paper swept off a desktop by a sudden draft. Fat Ass, also highly motivated, flopped over on his hands and knees and crawled a short distance and then hoisted himself up, courtesy of the rusty back bumper of a Dodge Ram 1500.</p> <p>As he and his buddies hustled away, the deputy nodded in approval. &#x201c;Evening, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; she said to Bell. &#x201c;Deputy Sturm. Thought you might be arriving right about now.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Met the welcoming committee.&#x201d; Bell stepped out of the Explorer and gestured toward the severe darkness that bordered the lot, a bottomless pit into which the four men had disappeared. The darkness seemed all the more menacing because of its adjacency to the garishly lit space. There was no middle ground. If you left the illuminated area, it was as if you&#x2019;d fallen off the edge of the world. <i>No dark like summer dark,</i> Bell thought. <i>No end to it. Goes on forever.</i></p> <p>She shuddered. She&#x2019;d had a sudden unwanted memory of the crime-scene photo still on her desk back at the courthouse: Freddie Arnett&#x2019;s lanky body facedown on the oil-stained concrete of his driveway, blood and brain matter shining wetly in the velvety glow of the front porch light.</p> <p>&#x201c;Those boys tried to get friendly with me, too.&#x201d; Sturm chuckled. With two fingers, she tapped the badge pinned to the left breast pocket of her gray polyester shirt. &#x201c;Then they saw this.&#x201d;</p> <p>Bell nodded. Enough with the small talk. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Shirley Dolan?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Right where I left her&#x2014;rounded up in the back of the bar with a bunch of troublemakers, waiting to see if I&#x2019;m going to give &#x2019;em even more of a hassle than I already have. Maybe haul &#x2019;em in for drunk and disorderly. They&#x2019;ve been calling me every name in the book and then some.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What started it?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t know. I mean, Bobo Bolland&#x2019;s here with his band, and it seems like he brings trouble wherever he goes. Somebody calls somebody else a low-down sumbitch or a man-stealing whore or something similar, and before you know it, the whole place goes crazy.&#x201d; Two more cars fishtailed into the lot, one right behind the other. The drivers must have caught the glint of the badge on Deputy Sturm&#x2019;s broad chest&#x2014;or, the more likely scenario, simply sniffed out the presence of the law after long experience with dodging same&#x2014;because their hasty U-turns back onto the road were executed with a panic-fed zeal.</p> <p>Sturm barely noticed. She and Bell had begun walking toward the door of Tommy&#x2019;s, and something else was on her mind. &#x201c;Listen,&#x201d; Sturm said. &#x201c;Before we go in, I wanted to say&#x2014;well, I heard about that poor old man. Hell of a thing. Bet folks in Acker&#x2019;s Gap are plenty shook up.&#x201d;</p> <p>Bell nodded. Freddie Arnett had suffered multiple blows to his head from a sledgehammer&#x2014;that was the coroner&#x2019;s preliminary analysis, given the shape of the wounds and the fact that the probable murder weapon was lying in the grass next to the driveway&#x2014;in an astonishingly vicious assault. No prints, no motive, no suspects, no leads; it was, Bell had reflected, almost as if the summer night itself had reared up and come after Arnett, as if the darkness had taken shape just long enough to grab a handy weapon and use it to crush an old man&#x2019;s skull, then spread itself out again in a soft black ooze.</p> <p>&#x201c;Makes you wonder,&#x201d; Sturm said.</p> <p>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d;</p> <p>They had reached the entrance to Tommy&#x2019;s. Bell heard muffled thuds from the other side of the wall, along with wicked guitar licks and fuzzy throbs from a cheap amplifier and the ominous insect hum of packed bodies rubbing up against one another.</p> <p>Sturm&#x2019;s big right hand reached for the dirty wooden handle. The upper half of one of the doors was smothered by a thumbtacked white poster that showed off the wobbly work of a black Sharpie:</p> <p><i>TONITE! BOBO BOLLAND AND HIS ROCKIN&#x2019; BAND!!! 11 pm to????</i></p> <p>Bell followed her into the bar&#x2014;and into the kind of frantic, sweaty bedlam that Bell had spent a good portion of her adult life trying to avoid, because it reminded her too much of her childhood, when the world was big and bad and loud and out of control, and she was the weakest, frailest thing in it. The prey.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>There she was.</p> <p>Shirley Dolan stood at the far end of the bar, her back to the nicked brown counter that featured what looked to be at least a century&#x2019;s worth of interlocking rings from wet-bottomed glasses of beer. Long gray hair frizzled down her narrow back. Bell had anticipated that it might take a ...</p></p><h2>The Floating Admiral</h2><p>The creators of Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple, Lord Peter Wimsey, and Father Brown collaborate on one mystery, all applying their unique expertise to solve the same case.

Home to one of the largest ornithological collections in the world, the Tring museum was full of rare bird specimens whose gorgeous feathers were worth staggering amounts of money to the men who shared Edwin's obsession: the Victorian art of salmon fly-tying. Once inside the museum, the champion fly-tier grabbed hundreds of bird skins--some collected 150 years earlier by a contemporary of Darwin's, Alfred Russel Wallace, who'd risked everything to gather them--and escaped into the darkness.<br><br>Two years later, Kirk Wallace Johnson was waist high in a river in northern New Mexico when his fly-fishing guide told him about the heist. He was soon consumed by the strange case of the feather thief. What would possess a person to steal dead birds? Had Edwin paid the price for his crime? What became of the missing skins? In his search for answers, Johnson was catapulted into a years-long, worldwide investigation. The gripping story of a bizarre and shocking crime, and one man's relentless pursuit of justice, The Feather Thief is also a fascinating exploration of obsession, and man's destructive instinct to harvest the beauty of nature.</p><p></p><h2>Fundamentals of Photography</h2><p>Photographs can preserve cherished memories, reveal the beauty of life, and even change the world.

Kramer uses vocabulary specific to dog-sled racing and includes a short glossary. She gives a brief history of the race, but assumes that readers already know about it and are interested in the sport. The writing is appropriate for the intended audience, although the narrative drags at points. Also, Riddles's thoughts as presented here clearly seem to be conjecture.

Monsters rule the streets, leaving nothing but murder in their wake. Those who do not die become slaves to Furnace's reign of cruelty. Alex is a monster too. He is the only one who can stop Furnace but in doing so he could destroy everything. Is he the executed or the executioner? Who will die? All Alex knows is that one way or another, it all ends now. <br><i>Execution </i>is an Escape from Furnace book from Alexander Gordon Smith.</p></p><p><p>ALEXANDER GORDON SMITH lives in Norwich, England. He is a co-founder of Fear Driven Films, which is currently producing its first feature film. The Escape from Furnace series marks his publishing debut in the United States. Mr. Smith is currently at work on his next book, <i>The Fury</i>, which Farrar Straus Giroux will publish in the fall of 2013.</p>THE BOY<br>&nbsp;<br><br>I ONCE KNEW A BOY. HIS NAME WAS ALEX SAWYER.<br>He was the boy who stared back at me from the mirror, a kid like any other. Not bad-looking, a little scrawny. You wouldn&#x2019;t have looked twice if you&#x2019;d seen him on the street.<br>That boy, he&#x2019;s dead now. I let him die. But I want to tell you his story. I <i>need</i> to tell you his story.<br>I don&#x2019;t remember much of Alex&#x2019;s&#x2014;of <i>my</i>&#x2014;life before Furnace. It&#x2019;s a blur of faceless people and half-formed places. He had a family once, I think, a mom and a dad. And friends too. But he wasn&#x2019;t a good kid, I remember that much at least. He was a bully, and a thief. He took from the ones he loved and all he gave in return was grief. I can&#x2019;t even remember how it all started, only that he wanted things like shoes, a bike, a computer.<br>That&#x2019;s what I find hardest to believe about all this&#x2014;not the truth about Furnace, or the monsters spawned inside the prison, but that Alex&#x2019;s life was destroyed because he was so desperate to get a new pair of sneakers.<br>Bullying in the playground, stealing the odd fiver at lunchtime, it wasn&#x2019;t enough. Alex and his best friend, Toby, started burgling houses, stealing cash and valuables every chance they could. One day they broke into a place they thought was empty. It wasn&#x2019;t. They were caught by silver-eyed giants in black suits and a shriveled figure with a gas mask stitched into its face. Toby was shot and Alex was framed for his murder&#x2014;sentenced to life without possibility of parole in Furnace Penitentiary.<br>Furnace. The prison. I&#x2019;ve been out for less than twenty-four hours but already my memories from inside are fading. Buried a mile beneath the ground, nothing but rock in every direction, it was a place that society put children they no longer wanted, where even their parents would forget them. It was a place where kids like Alex were buried alive.<br>But it was something so much worse than that too. The gas-masked wheezers stalked the cells, dragging inmates into the blood-drenched tunnels beneath the prison. Deformed creatures emerged in the dead of night, tearing their victims to pieces. And watching over it all was Warden Cross, a man as cruel and as dangerous as the devil himself, a man whose eyes were so full of madness, of hatred, of rancid glee, that meeting them was like watching yourself die a million times over.<br>Together with friends&#x2014;Donovan and Zee&#x2014;Alex made a plan to get out, smuggling gas-filled gloves from the kitchen and blowing a hole in the floor, jumping into an underground river. They did what nobody else had ever managed, they found a way out of Furnace. But that river only carried them as far as the tunnels below, and the unthinkable horrors of solitary confinement.<br>It was here that I&#x2014;no, not me, that <i>Alex</i>&#x2014;discovered the truth about Furnace. The prisoners were being turned into monsters, their minds and bodies broken and stitched back together into something new, something awful. Under the ever-watchful gaze of the warden those kids were pumped full of a dark, gold-flecked fluid known as nectar. It primed their bodies, made them stronger than they ever could have become naturally, able to withstand any injury. Then the wheezers opened them up, packing them full of muscle, giving them eyes of silver and setting them loose upon the world.<br>The lucky ones died on the operating table. Others became blacksuits&#x2014;the hulking guards who remembered nothing of the children they once were, who craved only more and more power. Some found themselves broken beyond repair, losing their minds completely to become rats&#x2014;feral killing machines that roamed the tunnels beneath Furnace butchering anyone they encountered.<br>And some became something worse still. Their genes evolved, making them bigger, faster, stronger than nature ever intended, beasts of unimaginable fury that looked more alien than human. The berserkers.<br>Alex and Zee were rescued from solitary by a boy called Simon&#x2014;a kid who had been half turned by the warden&#x2019;s surgery, his torso and one arm now that of a blacksuit, his eyes silver. And they&#x2014;we&#x2014;had made a break for freedom, trying to climb the shaft of the prison incinerator. But they were found, they were recaptured, and this time the warden wasted no time putting Alex under the knife.<br>I don&#x2019;t remember the pain, only the strength it brought. My body, it was cut apart and put back together. It was <i>improved</i>. I was no longer Alex, I was something better, something more. The warden filled my head with promises of power, told me of the war that was about to come between the strong and the weak, between the monsters and the humans, spoke of the new Fatherland that would rise from the ashes of the old world. I almost forgot who I was, I almost became one of the warden&#x2019;s children, a Soldier of Furnace.<br>And it was then that I first heard Alfred Furnace himself, the mysterious force behind all of this madness. Furnace didn&#x2019;t live within the prison, but his dark presence filled every single one of the creatures who dwelled here; it gripped their every thought, determined their actions. He was their commander, their god, and his power was absolute.<br>But some part of me resisted him, remembering my name, remembering my old life. Zee, Simon, and I, we fought our way back to general population, to the main body of the prison, and together with the inmates we cracked the gates, we busted out of Furnace.<br>We thought we&#x2019;d made it. We thought we were free. But the prison break was just what Alfred Furnace wanted. His forces were waiting in the shadows&#x2014;an army of blacksuits and berserkers. And with the city distracted by the escaping prisoners he made his move. He began his war on humanity.<br>He had a secret weapon too, a new strain of nectar, a red-flecked poison that spread like a plague. Any child who was bitten, who was filled with this improved nectar, became a super-rat, driven by fury and intent on nothing but slaughter. Within hours of the break the city fell as the new breed of rats ran riot. The army was called in, a state of emergency was declared, but it was too late: Furnace&#x2019;s nightmare force was unstoppable.<br>And my role in this?<br>I&#x2019;m not sure I know. I was bitten by a berserker shortly after we escaped, my blood tainted by the new nectar. But it was a small bite, not enough to turn me into one of them. After that I had visions in my head, visions that came from Furnace himself, channeled into my mind through the nectar. He showed me a tower, a skyscraper, on which a creature sat and howled at the world below. I thought it was him, thought that beast was Furnace, and I knew I had to try to kill him. I made a plan with Simon, Zee, and Lucy&#x2014;a girl we&#x2019;d met in the city. Zee and Lucy went off to find the army, to tell them to destroy the tower. Simon and I went after Furnace.<br>I didn&#x2019;t find him there. I found the warden. He filled himself with new nectar, becoming more powerful than any human had the right to be. Then we fought, both of us almost dying. The only way I survived was by drinking the blood from his veins, draining him of the new nectar. It saved my life, but it cost me the last of my sanity. I killed the warden&#x2014;fed him to his own ghastly creations&#x2014;but in doing so I became something worse. Because that&#x2019;s what Furnace wanted too&#x2014;the warden had failed him, and he needed a new general. He wanted <i>me</i> to become his right-hand man.<br>Warden Cross may have lost, but Alfred Furnace had won.<br>I climbed to the roof of the tower&#x2014;now engulfed with flames as military jets bombarded it with missiles&#x2014;I perched on the spire, and saw the city crumbling beneath me. Then I screamed, realizing that the creature I had seen in my vision wasn&#x2019;t Furnace at all.<br>It was me.<br>It&#x2019;s no wonder I didn&#x2019;t recognize myself. I had lost both of my hands&#x2014;my right arm turned into a blade of obsidian flesh, my left blown off at the elbow by a grenade. My body had been changed by the new nectar. I was taller than ever before, stronger too. But it was more than that. Furnace&#x2019;s poison surged through my mind as well, stripping away the last of my memories, the last scraps of the boy I used to be.<br>I made a promise, right there on that tower: I would find Alfred Furnace, and I would kill him. And if the world stood in my way then God help it, because I would tear it apart, I would watch it burn.<br>Nothing would stop me from having my revenge.<br>That boy, that kid called Alex Sawyer, he wouldn&#x2019;t have wanted this. But he no longer has a say. He&#x2019;s dead.<br>I need to tell you his story, though. I need to tell you how it ends.<br>Because it&#x2019;s the only chance I have of bringing him back.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2011 by Alexander Gordon Smith<br></p><h2>The Barber Book</h2><p><p><strong>A fun and instructive guide to the most popular men's hairstyles of the 20th century</strong></p><p><em>The Barber Book</em> is a fun guide to the most popular men's hairstyles of the 20th century, including quirky line drawings to achieve the 'total look' and instructions on how to cut each style.</p><p>Packed with information this smart handbook uses quirky illustrations and vintage photographs to explore the most popular hairstyles of the 20th century from the undercut and the afro to the classic Madison Avenue look.</p><p>With a focus on personalities, culture and fashions and cultural events that inspired each look, the book opens with an illustrated introduction exploring the most popular styles of the 1940s, 50s and 60s through archival photography.</p><p>The book includes a brand new directory of the world's finest barber shops.</p></p><p>Illustrated by Italian artist Matteo Guarnaccia<p>"A natty new volume from Phaidon, <em>The Barber Book</em>, is the most comprehensive and stylish treatise yet on everything related to our hair and how we wear it." &#x2014;<em>AskMen</em></p><p>"This guide to the essential cut and styles since of dawn of rock 'n' roll picks out the cream of the proverbial crop. ...take it to your barber and point to your favourite" &#x2014;<em>ShortList</em></p><p>"packed with a rich array of archive photography and illustrations for you to copy" &#x2014;<em>Toni &amp; Guy Magazine</em></p><p>"We can tell the world who we are through our haircut." &#x2014;The Herald</p><p>"You're only as good as your last haircut." &#x2014;Fran Lebowitz</p><p>"For me, it's all about the haircut.

And so she was -- until the memory of a cherished moment with a blue-eyed stranger suddenly returned to haunt her with savage intensity.

Her career spanned five decades and she continued to write historical fiction and romantic suspense until her death in 1993.<p><b>One</b></p> <p>When my Aunt Charlotte died suddenly many people believed that I had killed her and that if it had not been for Nurse Loman's evidence at the inquest, the verdict would have been one of murder by some person or persons unknown; there would have been a probing into the dark secrets of the Queen's House, and the truth would have come out.</p> <p>"That niece of hers obviously had the motive," it was said.</p> <p>The "motive" was Aunt Charlotte's possessions which on her death became mine. But how different everything was from what it appeared to be!</p> <p>Chantel Loman, who had become my friend during the months she lived with us at the Queen's House, laughed at the gossips.</p> <p>"People must have drama. If it isn't there they invent it. Sudden death is manna from Heaven. Of course they talk. Take no notice of them. I don't."</p> <p>She did not have the same need to do so, I pointed out to her.</p> <p>She laughed at me. "You're always so logical!" she said. "Why, Anna, I do believe that if those wicked old gossips had had their wish and you had stood in the dock you would have got the better of the judge as well as the jury and counsel for the prosecution. You can look after yourself."</p> <p>If only it were true! But Chantel did not know of those sleepless nights when I lay in my bed making plans, trying to work out how I could dispose of everything and start a new life in a new place and so free myself from this haunting nightmare. But in the morning it would be different. Practical considerations forced themselves on me. I could not go away; it was not financially possible. Little did the gossips know the true state of affairs. Moreover I was not going to be a coward and run away. As long as one was innocent what did it matter what the world thought of one?</p> <p>A foolish paradox, I told myself immediately, and an untrue one. The innocent frequently suffer when they are suspected of guilt, and it is necessary not only to be innocent but to prove that one is.</p> <p>But I could not run away; so I put on what Chantel called my mask and turned a face of cold indifference to the world. No one was going to know how deeply I cared about the slander.</p> <p>I tried to see everything objectively. In fact I could not have endured those months if I had not looked upon what happened as an unpleasant fantasy like a drama being played out on a stage, the chief characters being the victim and the suspect-Aunt Charlotte and myself-and in the minor roles, Nurse Chantel Loman, Dr. Elgin, Mrs. Morton the cook-housekeeper, Ellen the maid, and Mrs. Buckle who came in to dust the cluttered rooms. I was trying to convince myself that it had not really happened and one morning I should wake up to find it was nothing but a nightmare.</p> <p>So I was not logical but foolish and even Chantel did not know how vulnerable. I dared not look back and I dared not look forward. Yet when I saw my reflection in the mirror I was aware of the changes in my face. I was twenty-seven and looked it; before, I had appeared young for my age. I imagined myself at thirty-seven...forty-seven...still living in the Queen's House, getting older and older, haunted by the ghost of Aunt Charlotte; and the gossip would go on, never to be entirely forgotten and those not yet born would one day say: "That's old Miss Brett. There was some scandal long ago. I never heard quite what. I believe she murdered someone."</p> <p>It must not come to that. There were days when I promised myself I would escape, but the old stubbornness returned. I was a soldier's daughter. How many times had my father said to me: "Never turn your back on trouble. Always stand and face it."</p> <p>That was what I was trying to do when once more Chantel came to my rescue.</p> <p>But the story begins before that.</p> <p>***</p> <p>When I was born my father was a Captain in the Indian Army; he was Aunt Charlotte's brother; there was a great deal of the soldier in her. People are unpredictable. They appear to conform to patterns. Often you can say he or she is such and such a type, but people are rarely types, or not completely so. They conform up to a point and then they diverge wildly. So it was with both my father and Aunt Charlotte. Father was dedicated to his profession. The Army was more important than anything in the world; in fact little else existed for him. My mother often said that he would have run the household like a military camp if she had let him and treated us all as though we were his "men." He quoted Queen's Regulations at breakfast, she said mockingly; and he would grin sheepishly at her for she was his divergence. They had met when he was on his way home on leave from India. She told me about it in what I called her butterfly way. She never kept to the point and she would stray off so that one had to guide her back to the original theme if one were interested in it. Sometimes it was more intriguing to let her run on.</p> <p>But I was interested to hear about my parents' meeting so I kept her to it.</p> <p>"Moonlit nights on deck, darling. You've no idea how romantic... Dark skies and the stars like jewels...and the music and the dancing. The foreign ports and those fantastic bazaars. This heavenly bracelet... Oh the day we bought that..."</p> <p>She would have to be led back. Yes, she had been dancing with the First Officer and she had noticed the tall soldier, so aloof, and she had made a bet that she would make him dance with her. Of course she had and they were married two months later in England.</p> <p>"Your Aunt Charlotte was furious. Did she think the poor man was a eunuch?"</p> <p>Her conversation was light and frothy-racy even. She fascinated me as she must have fascinated my father. I was far more like him, I feared, than like her.</p> <p>In those early days I lived with them though I was more often in the company of my ayah than in theirs. There are vague memories of heat and brilliantly colored flowers, of dark-skinned people washing their clothes in the river. I remember riding in an open carriage with my ayah past the cemetery on the hill where I was told the bodies of the dead were left out in the open that they might become part of the earth and air again. I remember the wicked-looking vultures high up in the trees. They made me shiver.</p> <p>There came the time when I must return to England and I traveled back with my parents, and myself experienced those tropical nights at sea when the stars seemed to have been placed like jewels on dark blue velvet as though to show off their brilliance. I heard the music and saw the dancing; and for me everything was dominated by my mother, the most beautiful being in the world, with her long draperies, her dark hair piled high on her head, and her incessant, inconsequential chatter.</p> <p>"Darling, it will only be for a short time. You have to be educated, and we have to go back to India. But you'll stay with Auntie Charlotte." It was typical that she should call her Auntie. Aunt Charlotte was always Aunt to me. "She'll love you darling, because you're named after her-well, partly. They wanted Charlotte for you, but I wasn't going to have my darling daughter called that. It would remind me of her..." She caught herself up sharply, remembering she was trying to put Aunt Charlotte in a good light. "People always like those who have their names. &#x2018;But not Charlotte,' I said, &#x2018;That's too severe...' So you were Anna Charlotte to be known as Anna and so avoid having two Charlottes in the family. Oh, where was I? Your Auntie Charlotte... Yes, darling, you have to go to school, my precious, but there are holidays. You can't come all the way out to India in the holidays, can you? So Auntie Charlotte will have you at the Queen's House. Now doesn't that sound grand? Queen Elizabeth slept there, I believe. That's where it gets its name. And then...in no time...my goodness how time flies, you'll be finished with school and you'll come out to us. I can't wait, my darling, for the day. What fun I shall have launching my daughter." Again that attractive grimace which I believe is called a moue. "It will be my compensation for getting old."</p> <p>She could make anything sound attractive by the way she spoke of it. She could dismiss years with a flick of the hand. She made me see not school and Aunt Charlotte but the days ahead when the ugly duckling I was would be transformed into the swan, looking exactly like my mother.</p> <p>I was eight years old when I saw the Queen's House for the first time. The cab which had brought us from the station took us through streets very different from those of Bombay. The people looked sedate, the houses imperious. Here and there was a touch of green in the gardens, such green as I had not seen in India, deep and cool; there was a light drizzle in the air. We caught a glimpse of the river for the town of Langmouth was situated on the estuary of the River Lang and it was for this reason that it had become the busy port it was. Scraps of my mother's chatter lived on in my mind. "What a big ship! Look darling. I suppose that belongs to those people...what's their name, darling?-those rich and powerful people who own half Langmouth and half of England for that matter?" And my father's voice: "You mean the Creditons, my dear. They do in fact own a very prosperous shipping line but you exaggerate when you say they own half Langmouth, although it is true that Langmouth owes a certain part of its growing prosperity to them."</p> <p>The Creditons! The name stayed with me.</p> <p>"They would have a name like that," said my mother. "The creditable Creditons."</p> <p>My father's lips twitched as they did for my mother; it meant he wanted to laugh but felt it was undignified for a Major to do so. He had gained his majority since my birth and extra dignity with it. He was unapproachable, stern, honorable; and I was as proud of him as I was of my mother.</p> <p>And so we came to the Queen's House. The carriage drew up before a high red brick wall in which was a wrought-iron gate. It was an exciting moment because standing there looking up at that ancient wall one had no idea what one would find on the other side. And when the gate was opened and we went through it and it shut behind us, the feeling came to me that I had stepped into another age. I had shut out Victorian Langmouth, made prosperous by the industrious Creditons, and had stepped back three hundred years in time.</p> <p>The garden ran down to the river. It was well kept, though not elaborate and not large either-I should say perhaps three quarters of an acre at most. There were two lawns divided by a path of crazy paving, and on the lawns were shrubs which would doubtless flower in spring or summer; at that time of year they were draped with spiders' webs on which globules of moisture glistened. There was a mass of Michaelmas daisies-like lovely mauve stars, I thought them-and reddish and gold-colored chrysanthemums. The fresh smell of damp earth, grass, and green foliage and the faint scent of the flowers was so different from the heavy frangipani perfume of the blooms which grew in such profusion in the hot steamy Indian air.</p> <p>A path led to the house, which was of three stories-wider than it was tall; it was of the same red brick as the wall. There was an iron-studded door and beside it a heavy iron bell. The windows were latticed, and I believed that I was aware of a certain air of menace, but that may have been because I knew that I was to be left here in the charge of Aunt Charlotte while my parents went away to their gay and colorful life. That was the truth. There was no warning. I did not believe in such things.</p> <p>Even my mother though was a little subdued on that occasion; but Aunt Charlotte had the power to subdue anyone.</p> <p>My father-who was not nearly such a martinet as he liked to pretend-may have been aware of my fear; it may have occurred to him that I was very young to be left to the mercy of school, Aunt Charlotte and the Queen's House. But it was no unusual fate. It was happening to young people all the time. It was, as he told me before he left me, a worthwhile experience because it taught one to be self-reliant, to face up to life, to stand on one's own feet; he had a stock of clich�s to meet occasions like this.</p> <p>He tried to warn me. "This is reckoned to be a very interesting house," he told me. "You'll find your Aunt Charlotte an interesting woman. She runs this business...she's clever at it. She buys and sells valuable old furniture. She'll tell you all about it. That's why she's got this interesting old house. She keeps the furniture she buys here and people come here to see it. She couldn't keep it all in her shop. And of course this sort of business is not ordinary business, so it is quite proper for Aunt Charlotte to do this. It is not as though she were selling butter or sugar over a counter."</p> <p>I was puzzled by these social differences but too overawed by my new experiences to bother with such trifles.</p> <p>He pulled the rope, the old bell clanged and after a wait of some minutes the door was opened by Ellen who dropped a flustered curtsy and bade us come in.</p> <p>We stepped into a dark hall; odd shapes loomed up all about us and I saw that it was not so much furnished as full of furniture. There were several grandfather clocks and some elaborate ones in ormolu; their ticking was very audible in the silence. The ticking of clocks was something I would always associate with the Queen's House. I noticed two Chinese cabinets, some chairs and several small tables, a bookcase and desk. They were simply put there, not arranged.</p> <p>Ellen had run off and a woman was coming toward us. I thought at first she was Aunt Charlotte. I should have known that her neat white cap and black bombazine dress indicated the housekeeper.</p> <p>"Ah, Mrs. Morton," said my father who knew her well. "Here we are with my daughter."</p> <p>"Madam is in her sitting room," said Mrs. Morton. "I will inform her that you have arrived."</p> <p>"Pray do," said my father.</p> <p>My mother looked at me. "Isn't it fascinating?" she whispered, half fearfully, which told me she didn't think so but wanted me to. "All these priceless, precious things! Just look at that escritoire! I'll bet it belonged to the King of the Barbarines."</p> <p>"Beth," murmured my father in indulgent reproof.</p> <p>"And look at the claws on the arms of that chair. I'm sure it means something. Just think, darling, you may discover. I'd love to know all about these lovely things."</p> <p>Mrs. Morton had returned, hands neatly folded over bombazine stomach.</p> <p>"Madam wishes you to come at once to her sitting room."</p> <p>We ascended a staircase lined with tapestries and a few oil paintings which led us straight into a room which seemed to be filled with more furniture; another room led from this and from that another and this third was Aunt Charlotte's sitting room.</p> <p>And there she was-tall, gaunt, looking I thought like my father dressed up as a woman; her mid-brown hair with streaks of gray in it was pulled straight back from her big strong face and made into a knot at the back of her head. She wore a tweed skirt and jacket and a severe olive green blouse, the same color as her eyes. I knew afterward that they took their color from her clothes; and as she usually wore grays and that dark shade of green they seemed that tinge too....</p></p><h2>And the Life of the World to Come: Reflections on the Biblical Notion of Heaven</h2><p><p>How do worshippers understand the poetic line "and the life of the world to come" when they pray the creed? Are they thinking of a geographical destination? A celestial community they will ultimately join? A participation in the life of the Trinity: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit?</p><p>Questions like these inspired John Craghan to mine the biblical texts for insight and answers about heaven. His exploration of the Christian understanding of the "afterlife" moves through the understandings of ancient Israel to the synoptic Gospels and ultimately to the nascent beliefs of the early Christians as reflected in the letters of Paul and the book of Revelation. Grounded firmly in Scripture and written in a lively accessible style, <i>And the Life of the World to Come</i> is an intellectual and spiritual journey for readers that are willing to explore their own beliefs and anxieties about the heavenly home promised by Jesus.</p></p><p>John F. Craghan is professor emeritus of religious studies at St. Norbert College in De Pere, Wisconsin. He is North American editor for <i>Scripture in Church</i> (Dominican Publications) and is the author of numerous books, including <i>I Was Ill and You Cared for Me: Biblical Reflections on Serving the Physically and Mentally Impaired</i>; <i>Psalms for All Seasons</i>; <i>And the Life of the World to Come: Reflections on the Biblical Notion of Heaven</i>; and <i>The Gospels of the Weekday Lectionary</i>, all published by Liturgical Press.An inspirational and faithful read from John Craghan as he presents an exploration of the ultimate destination of the Christian, exploring what the Bible truly says about heaven.The Midwest Book Review<br><br>This is a magnificent compendium of biblical perspectives on what lies beyond death. Craghan's succinct and comprehensive summary of the diverse theologies of the afterlife found in the Bible points to a profound invitation to live life in the here and now, abiding with Christ and praying and working for the transformation of this world, while living in hope for what is yet only partially known.Barbara E. Reid, O.P., Vice President and Academic Dean, Catholic Theological Union <br><br>As John Craghan reflects upon biblical notions of heaven, he brings to this task years of scholarship and prayer. This volume helps us to imagine what God has in store for all those who follow God&#x2019;s way. After reading this thought-provoking work, the reader will understand that &#x2018;heaven is for real.&#x2019;+ Robert F. Morneau, Pastor of Resurrection Parish, Auxiliary Bishop of Green Bay <br><br>John Craghan explores the many textures of our belief in <i>And the Life of the World to Come</i>. Rather than searching out the biblical basis for our doctrinal notions of heaven, he invites readers to imagine the pre-creedal beliefs of Jewish and early Christian communities, as we come to know them through various biblical witnesses. His crisp, clear introductions to each text&#x2014;whether it be Daniel or 2 Maccabees, John or Paul or the Synoptics&#x2014;make the question of &#x201c;the world to come&#x201d; come alive. He finds no inexorable trajectory of development to a single notion, but rather a multitude of witnesses which often intersect, especially with a sense of the importance of community or family in the new life, and one which somehow includes the entire cosmos, not only human beings. This is a work to be re-read and pondered again!John C. Endres, SJ, Professor of Old Testament/Hebrew Bible, Jesuit School of Theology, Berkeley, Santa Clara University</p><h2>Knit. Sock.

Heinlein--Williamson has always been in the forefront of the field, being the first to write fiction about genetic engineering (he invented the term), anti-matter, and other cutting-edge science. A renaissance man, Williamson is a master of fantasy and horror as well as science fiction. He lives in Portales, New Mexico.<br>1<br>&nbsp;<br><i>The Girl in White Fur</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The girl came up to Will Barbee while he stood outside of the glass-and-stucco terminal building at Trojan Field, Clarendon's new municipal airport, hopefully watching the leaden sky for a glimpse of the incoming planes. There was no reason for the sudden shiver that grated his teeth together--unless it was a fresh blast of the damp east wind. She looked as trimly cool and beautiful as a streamlined electric icebox.<br>She had a million dollars' worth of flame-red hair. White, soft, sweetly serious, her face confirmed his first dazzled impression--that she was something very wonderful and rare. She met his eyes, and her rather large mouth drew into a quick pleasant quirk.<br>Barbee turned to face her, breathless. He looked again into her gravely smiling eyes--they were really green. He searched her for the cause of that cold shudder of intuitive alarm, and became aware of an equally illogical attraction--life had turned Barbee a little cynical toward women, and he liked to consider himself totally immune.<br>Her green gabardine business suit was modishly severe, plainly expensive, and cunningly chosen to accent the color of her eyes. Against the windy chill of this overcast October afternoon, she wore a short coat of some heavy white fur that he decided must be Arctic wolf--bleached, perhaps, or albino.<br>But the kitten <i>was</i> unusual.<br>She carried a snakeskin novelty bag, with the double handle over her arm, like two thick coils of a diamondback. The bag was open, like a flattened basket, and the kitten peered contentedly out of it. It was a perfectly darling little black kitten, less than half grown. It wore a wide red silk ribbon, neatly tied in a double bow.<br>They made a striking picture, but the kitten, blinking peacefully at the lights coming on in the cloudy dusk, just didn't seem to fit. The girl didn't look quite the type to shriek with delight over such a clever pet. And the slick chick she appeared to be, the chic young businesswoman, simply wouldn't include even the very cutest black kitten in her street ensemble.<br>He tried to forget that odd little shiver of alarm, and wondered how she knew him. Clarendon was not a large city, and reporters get around. That red hair was something you wouldn't forget. He looked again, to be sure her disturbing eyes were really fixed on him. They were.<br>"Barbee?"<br>Her voice was crisp and vigorous. The soft, throaty vitality of it was as exciting, somehow, as her hair and her eyes. Her manner remained casually impersonal.<br>"Will Barbee," he admitted. "Leg man for the <i>Clarendon Star</i>."<br>More than ever interested, he enlarged upon that modest fact. Perhaps he hoped to discover the cause of his brief shiver. He didn't want her to go away.<br>"My editor wants two birds with one stone tonight," he told her. "The first is Colonel Walraven--twenty years since he wore the uniform, but still he likes the title. He has just quit a cushy berth in the Washington bureaucracy and come home to run for the senate. But he won't have much to say for the papers. Not till he sees Preston Troy."<br>The girl was still listening. The black kitten yawned at the lights flashing on, and the little crowd of waiting relatives and friends clustered along the steel-mesh barrier that kept the public off the field, and the white-clad attendants beyond, busy preparing to service the planes. But the girl's intense green eyes still watched his face, and her magical voice murmured softly:<br>"Who is your other bird?"<br>"A big one," Barbee said. "Dr. Lamarck Mondrick. Kingpin of the Humane Research Foundation, out by the university. He's due here tonight, on a chartered plane from the West Coast, with his little expedition. They've been to the Gobi--but probably you know all about them?"<br>"No." Something in her voice stirred his pulse. "What about them?"<br>"Archeologists," he said. "They had dug in Mongolia before the war. When the Japs surrendered, in '45, they cut all sorts of diplomatic red tape to get back again. Sam Quain, who is Mondrick's right hand man, had served on some war mission to China, and he knew the ropes. I don't know exactly what they went to look for, but it must be something special."<br>She looked interested, and he went on:<br>"They're our home-town boys, coming back tonight, after two years of perilous tangles with armies and bandits and sandstorms and scorpions, in darkest Mongolia. They're supposed to be bringing home something that will rock the world of archeology."<br>"And what would that be?"<br>"My job tonight is to find that out." Barbee still studied her with gray puzzled eyes. The black kitten blinked at him happily. Nothing about her explained that brief tingle of intuitive alarm. Her green-eyed smile seemed still aloofly impersonal, and he was afraid she would go away. Gulping, he asked desperately:<br>"Do I know you?"<br>"I'm a rival." She was suddenly less remote; her voice held a purring chuckle of friendliness. "April Bell, of the <i>Clarendon Call</i>." She showed him a tiny black notebook, palmed in her left hand. "I was warned to beware of you, Will Barbee."<br>"Oh." He grinned and nodded toward the little groups of passengers inside the glass front of the terminal building, waiting for the airliner. "I was afraid you had just stopped off, on your way back to Hollywood or Broadway. But you aren't really on the <i>Call</i>?" He looked at that flame-colored hair, and shook his head in admiration.<br>"I'd have seen you."<br>"I'm new," she admitted. "In fact, I took my journalism degree just last summer. I only began Monday on the <i>Call</i>, and this is my first real assignment." Her voice was childishly confidential. "I'm afraid I'm pretty much a stranger in Clarendon, now--I was born here, but we went to California when I was still a little girl."<br>Her white teeth gleamed, in a smile innocently hopeful.<br>"I'm so new," she confided softly, "and I want so much to make good on the <i>Call</i>. I do want to turn in a good story on this Mondrick expedition. It all sounds so strange and thrilling, but I'm afraid I didn't learn many ologies in college. Would you mind, Barbee, if I ask you a few silly questions?"<br>Barbee was looking at her teeth. They were even and strong and very white--the sort of teeth with which beautiful women in dentifrice advertisements gnawed bones. It occurred to him that the spectacle of April Bell gnawing a red bone would be infinitely fascinating.<br>"Would you really mind?"<br>Barbee gulped and called back his thoughts. He grinned at her, beginning to understand. She was a fresh cub, new to the newspaper game--but clever as Lilith. The kitten was doubtless intended to complete a touching picture of helpless femininity, and annihilate any male resistance that her appealing eyes and devastating hair had failed to conquer.<br>"We're rivals, lady," he reminded her, as sternly as possible. Her look of hurt reproach tugged at him, but he kept the gruff abruptness in his voice. "And your name couldn't really be April Bell."<br>"It was Susan." Her greenish eyes turned dark, pleading hopefully. "But I think April will look so much nicer on my first by-line." Her voice was small and husky. "Please--about the expedition--Dr. Mondrick must be pretty important, if all the papers want a story on him?"<br>"He'll make good copy," Barbee agreed. "His whole expedition is only four men, and I'm sure they had quite an adventure, just getting to those sites in the desert and back again, in times like these. Sam Quain has Chinese friends, and they must have helped."<br>With a tiny fountain pen, she made flowing marks in the little black notebook. The deft smooth grace of her white hands, oddly, made him think of some wild creature, unfettered and shy.<br>"Chinese friends," she murmured as she wrote, and looked up beseechingly. "Really, haven't you any idea what it is they're bringing back?"<br>"Not even a hint," he told her. "Somebody at the Foundation just called the <i>Star</i> this afternoon, and tipped us off that they'd be here in a chartered plane, by seven. The Foundation man said they'd have a hot story--some big scientific announcement. He wanted photographers, and scientific staff writers, but the <i>Star</i> doesn't go in for heavy science. I'm supposed to cover Walraven and the expedition, too."<br>He was trying to remember the name of a certain mythological lady. She had been fascinating--as lovely, no doubt, as April Bell. But, in the legend, she had a disturbing way of changing the men she fascinated into unpleasant beasts. What was her name--Circe?<br>Barbee hadn't spoken that name aloud--he was certain of it. But a quick, humorous quirk of the girl's red mouth, and a gleam of slightly malicious amusement in her eyes, gave him a brief, rattled impression that he had--though he didn't even know what had made him think of that mythical sorceress.<br>For an uncomfortable instant, he tried to unravel the association. He had read a little of Menninger and Freud, and sampled Frazer's <i>Golden Bough</i>. The symbolism of such folktales, he knew, expressed the fears and hopes of early man, and the notion popping into his own head must betray something about his own unconscious. Exactly what, he didn't want to know.<br>He laughed abruptly, and said: "I'll tell you anything I can--though I'll probably get it in the neck when Preston Troy reads my story in the <i>Call</i>, too. Or shall I write it out for you?"<br>"My shorthand is very good, thank you."<br>"Well, Dr. Mondrick was a big-shot anthropologist at Clarendon University, before he resigned, ten years ago, to establish his Foundation. He's not one of your narrow specialists, and he doesn't blow his own horn. But any of his associates will tell you that he's about the greatest all-around student of mankind in the world today. Biologist, psychologist, archeologist, sociologist, ethnologist--he seems to know everything that matters about his pet subject, mankind.<br>"Mondrick is the big shot of the Foundation. He raises the jack and spends it--without much publicity about the exact projects he's at work on.

The story of two great English poets, Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning, whose work was immediately recognized and adored by their contemporaries, whose courtship ranks with the great love stories of all time -- and in whose marriage romance was not merely sustained but intensified.<br><br>We enter their story through the sealed Victorian world of the Barretts of Wimpole Street: Elizabeth, at thirty-nine, a poet of international fame, a child prodigy who had grown to be a middle-aged spinster, a woman for whom romantic love seemed not to be possible, confined by illness, morphine, and the tyranny of her father, scion of rich Jamaican slaveholders, rum and sugar traders.<br><br>It is to this fortress that Robert Browning, already an admired young poet and playwright, already a devotee of Elizabeth's, lays siege. ("I love your verses," he had written Elizabeth in his first letter to her, long before they met. "I love your verses with all my heart -- and I love you too.") And miraculously Elizabeth let life in.<br><br>Julia Markus chronicles their extraordinary courtship, their marriage in secret (Browning to Elizabeth: "How you have dared and done all this ... for my only sake?"), and their radiant honeymoon in Italy.<br><br>Markus shows us how the political events of the times inspired the great dramatic monologues of Robert's middle years and how Italy's stormy reunification inspired Elizabeth's later work.<br><br>We come to see Elizabeth as an artist with a fierce and final confidence in poetry and its effect on the poets' lives. We see husband and wife celebrate the birth of their son, Robert Wiedemann "Pen" Barrett Browning (Browning to her sisters: "I sate by [Elizabeth] as much as I was allowed, and I shall never forget what I saw, tho' I cannot speak about it").<br><br>We see them among their artist/writer friends: in London with Tennyson, Thackeray, Rossetti, and others; in Rome with William Story, the American lawyer, poet, sculptor; with Harriet Hosmer, the stonecutter, who was one of the models for Aurora Leigh; with Charlotte Cushman, the American actress, who held readings of Elizabeth's novel in verse. We see Elizabeth in Paris meeting her heroine George Sand, whose society of socialists and theatrical types Robert described as "ragged Red."<br><br>We come to understand Elizabeth's dependence on the ever-present drug in her life ("I should not be alive except by help of my morphine") and her constant battle with depression. And we see Elizabeth, encouraged by a woman with whom she was infatuated, move from interest to obsession with spiritualism, a cause that became the only source of serious dissension between the Brownings.<br><br>We follow the course of their rich marriage, from the beginning when each saw the other as a brilliant poet, a compassionate and strangely similar heart, through the years in which they discovered each other's differences, each remaining a complex and thrilling human being to the other.<br><br>To tell their story, Markus for the first time makes use of much of Elizabeth's unpublished correspondence, amid a wealth of other documents. She delves fully into the Brownings' Creole background and shows how it affected their lives and their work (Elizabeth was the first of the Jamaican Barretts to be born in England in many generations).<br><br>Brilliantly interweaving the Brownings' own words with her authentic and perceptive narrative, Julia Markus brings these two great poets -- their marriage, their work, their times -- alive as never before.</p><p>Julia Markus graduated from Boston University and received her Ph.D. from the University of Maryland. Robert Browning was the subject of her doctoral thesis, and she has written extensively on both Brownings. She served for eight years on the Board of Directors of the Browning Institute. Ms. Markus is the Director of Creative Writing at Hofstra University. She is the author of four novels: Uncle, which won the Houghton Mifflin Literary Award, American Rose. Friends Along the Way, and A Change of&#39; Luck. Her articles and reviews have appeared in Smithsonian and The New York Times. She lives in Connecticut and New York City and is at work on a novel.Novelist turned literary historian Markus has lifted the veils of misconception that have long concealed the truth about that most poetic and celebrated of love stories and marriages, that of Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Robert Browning. Along the way, Markus also reaffirms Barrett Browning's standing as a major English poet. It's ironic, Markus says, that Barrett Browning's <i>Sonnets from the Portuguese</i> "landed on the cute shelf" in bookstores when it is, in fact, a serious cycle of poems about the choice between love and death. The eldest child of a tyrannical father whose fortune came from his family's Jamaican plantations, Barrett Browning was a 39-year-old invalid and recluse when the handsome, robust, and sincere Browning strode into her life, already in love with her from reading her poetry. His love and conviction transformed Barrett, who triumphed over her ailments and defied her father (he had forbidden all 12 of his sons and daughters to marry). Markus offers the convincing theory that Barrett was ashamed of his racially mixed background and lived in fear of having dark-skinned grandchildren. The lovers, however, were fearless on many fronts. As Markus chronicles the personal and artistic growth of this devoted couple, she insightfully analyzes their social and political milieu and how it shaped their lives and poetry. A fascinating study of what was truly a union of mind, body, and soul. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Developmental Psychology of the Black Child</h2><p>The first of a UBCS series of books dealing with the growth, development, and education of the black child; the first book which deals exclusively with the physical and psychosocial development of the black child, in a scholarly but readily understandable way, forthrightly confronts these and other issues.</p><p></p><h2>Unwritten Memories</h2><p>Edited by Elisabeth Plessen and Michael Mann.

It's supposed to show where we taste different things, like salty on the side of the tongue, sweet in the front, bitter in the back. Some guy drew it a hundred years ago, and people have been forcing kids to memorize it ever since.<br><br>But it's wrong--all wrong. As in, not even the slightest bit right. It turns out that our taste buds are all alike, they can taste everything, and they're all over the place. Mr. Landau, seventh-grade science teacher, has unrolled a beaten-up poster of the ignorant tongue map, and he's explaining about how people have misunderstood the science of taste since the beginning of time.<br><br>Everyone in my class, even Bob English Who Draws, is paying attention today, because this is the first day of "How We Taste," also known as The Science Unit of Destiny. They all believe that sometime in the next ten school days, at least one person in the room is going to discover his or her own personal fate: true love or tragic death.<br><br>Yes, those are the only two choices.<br>Bob English Who Draws is really named Robert English. Back in fourth grade, our teacher, Ms. Diamatis, started calling him Bob English Who Draws because he was always zoning out and doodling with a superfine Sharpie. Ms. Diamatis would say, "Bob English Who Draws, can you please take us through the eights?" It was her job to make sure no one got out of fourth grade without lightning-fast multiplication skills. And everyone has called him that ever since.<br><br>While the rest of the class is hanging on every syllable that comes out of Mr. Landau's mouth, I'm looking at the false tongue poster and I'm kind of wishing it wasn't wrong. There's something nice about those thick black arrows: sour here, salty there, like there's a right place for everything. Instead of the total confusion the human tongue actually turns out to be.<br>People, People<br><br>It's Friday afternoon, last period. Gym. Ms. Warner and I have done our Friday high five. We do it every week, because I hate school and she hates work, and we both live for Friday.<br><br>We're playing volleyball, with an exclamation point. Ms. Warner has written it on the whiteboard outside the gym doors: Volleyball!<br><br>The combination of seeing that word and breathing the smell of the first floor, which is the smell of the cafeteria after lunch, creates some kind of echo in my head, like a faraway shout.<br><br>In the morning, the cafeteria smells fried and sweet, like fish sticks and cookies. But after lunch, it's different. There's more kid sweat and garbage mixed in, I guess. Or maybe it's just that, after lunch, the cafeteria doesn't have the smell of things to come. It's the smell of what has been.<br><br>Volleyball!<br><br>Ms. Warner is at the net with her hands on her knees, calling stuff out to kids and smiling like crazy. "Shazam!" she yells when Eliza Donan gives the ball a halfhearted bump with her forearm. "Sweet shot!"<br><br>If you didn't know Ms. Warner, you'd think there's no place she'd rather be. Maybe she's trying out my mom's famous theory that if you smile for no reason at all you will actually start to feel happy. Mom's always telling me to smile and hoping I'll turn into a smiley person, which, to be honest, is kind of annoying. But I know she's extra-sensitive about me ever since she and Dad made their big announcement that we had to sell our house. She even recorded a bunch of America's Funniest Home Videos for me to watch: my smile therapy.<br><br>I tell Mom to please save her miracle cures for the hospital. She's a nurse in the intensive-care ward, where she has to check on her patients every fifteen minutes. It's a hard habit to break, I guess, all that checking. I've been watching the shows, though, and they do make me laugh. How can you not laugh at America's Funniest Home Videos? All those wacky animals. All that falling down.<br><br>I count the number of rotations we have left in "Volleyball!" before it's my serve and then glance at the huge clock in its protective cage on the wall. I calculate a fifty-fifty chance that the dismissal bell will save me, but the next thing I know I'm in that back corner, balancing the ball on one palm and getting ready to slap it with the other.<br><br>Don't look at the ball.<br><br>Point your eyes where you want the ball to go.<br><br>But the advice in my head is useless, because time slows down until everyone's voices transform into something that sounds like underwater whale-singing.<br><br>Well, obviously "underwater," I tell myself. Where else are you going to find whales?<br><br>I should be paying attention to the ball.<br><br>Just as I'm about to smack it, I get this feeling, this premonition, that I'm going to land the ball at least somewhere on the other side of the net, maybe even in that big hole in the second row where Mandy and Gabe are being careful not to stand too close because they secretly like each other.<br><br>I'm wrong, though. The ball goes high, falls short, and hits the floor between the feet of Dallas Llewellyn, who is standing right in front of me. My serve is what is called an epic fail, and some of the girls start doing the slow clap.<br><br>Clap.<br><br>Pause.<br><br>Clap.<br><br>Pause.<br><br>Clap.<br><br>It's sarcastic clapping. You know that famous philosophical question "What is the sound of one hand clapping?" Well, I have no idea, but it has to be better than the slow clap.<br><br>Ms. Warner is yelling "People! People!" like she always does when kids are mean and she has no idea what to do about it.<br><br>Dallas hands me the ball for my second try and I hit it right away, just to get it over with. This time it goes way left, out of bounds. Then the bell rings, kids fly in all directions, and the week is over.<br><br></p></p><h2>Twenty Holy Hours</h2><p>Book by Fr. Mateo Crawley-Boevey, SS.

Into it he poured all the anguish and torment a Jew can feel when torn between the faith of his fathers and the calling of his art. Here Asher Lev plunges back into his childhood and recounts the story of love and conflict which dragged him to this crossroads.</p><p>My Name is Asher Lev-Chaim Potok became a favorite author of mine after reading My Name is Asher Lev. I've since had the pleasure of hearing Chaim Potok speak on two occasions. To hear him answer questions regarding Asher Lev and his paintings is evidence of the true craftsmanship of this author. A most amazing part of the story is the integration of Christian ideals in the Jewish character of Asher Lev and his artwork. Its a truly remarkable story.<br><br>-Jocelyn Schmidt, Ballantine National Sales CoordinatorAsher Lev is a Ladover Hasid who keeps kosher, prays three times a day and believes in the Ribbono Shel Olom, the Master of the Universe. Asher Lev is an artist who is compulsively driven to render the world he sees and feels even when it leads him to blasphemy.In this stirring and often visionary novel, Chaim Potok traces Asher's passage between these two identities, the one consecrated to God, the other subject only to the imagination. <br>Asher Lev grows up in a cloistered Hasidic community in postwar Brooklyn, a world suffused by ritual and revolving around a charismatic Rebbe. But in time his gift threatens to estrange him from that world and the parents he adores. As it follows his struggle, My Name Is Asher Lev becomes a luminous portrait of the artist, by turns heartbreaking and exultant, a modern classic.</p><h2>Isaeus (Loeb Classical Library) (Greek and English Edition)</h2><p><p>Though he occupies a firm place in the canon of the ten Attic orators, Isaeus seems not to have been an Athenian, but a metic, being a native of Chalcis in Euboea. From passages in his work he is inferred to have lived from about 420 to 350 BCE. But no contemporary mentions him, and it is from Dionysius of Halicarnassus that we learn he was the teacher of Demosthenes, a fact confirmed by several unmistakable examples of borrowing from or imitation of him by his great pupil.</p><p>Isaeus took no part in politics, but composed speeches for others, particularly in cases of inheritance. While he shares with Lysias the merits of a pure Attic and a lucidity of style, Isaeus is more aggressive and more flexible in his presentation; and in these respects he undoubtedly influenced Demosthenes. We learn of the existence in ancient times of at least fifty orations, but all that has come down to us are eleven speeches on legacy cases and a large fragment of a speech dealing with a claim of citizenship.</p></p><p><p>Edward Seymour Forster (1879&#x2013;1950) was Lecturer in Classics at the University of Sheffield.</p></p><h2>The Night of Morningstar: A Modesty Blaise Novel</h2><p>Modesty Blaise and her partner, Willie Garvin, try to stop the Watchmen, the secret group behind a series of seemingly random acts of violence</p><p><b>Peter O&#x2019;Donnell</b> created the Modesty Blaise strip cartoon in the 1950s and is the author of 13 Modesty Blaise novels.In this new Modesty Blaise adventure, a mysterious, well-heeled group called the Watchmen are making terrorist attacks against various governments East and West. Modesty faces danger in London, San Francisco and off the coast of Portugal as she and Willie Garvin fend off assassins, save the Golden Gate Bridge and thwart the Watchmen's "Morningstar" operation. The intrepid duo grasps the full enormity of the Watchmen's scheme only when they're in the clutches of the villains; the night is saved by our heroes' ingenuity, combat ability andnot leastModesty's truly amazing "muscle control." The bad guys are a nicely rum lot of Russians, Germans, Poles and Brits; the mad Earl is especially well drawn. Modesty is still beautifully lethal and Willie still drops atiches sporadically, but they show their age when they leave a concert after the Beethoven and before the Mahler, to "dine at a reasonable hour." Modesty Blaise fans will love this romp, which, despite huge casualties, is actually rather cozy. Two hilarious sex scenes with an equestrian Countess add to all the fun. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Adventures of Dr. McNinja: Night Powers</h2><p>What&#39;s better than an evil unicorn motorcycle, monster gang wars, a tennis match against a god of destruction, and banditos on velociraptors - in full color?

Johnson, a noted lecturer and Jungian analyst, is also the author of <em>He, She, We, Inner Work, Ecstasy, Transformation,</em> and <em>Owning Your Own Shadow. </em></p><p>Chapter One</p><br><p>The Myth of Dionysus</p><br><p>I am Dionysus, the son of Zeus,<br>come back to Thebes, this land where I was born.<br>My mother was Cadmus' daughter, Semele by name,<br>midwived by fire, delivered by lightning's<br>blast.<br> And here I stand, a god incognito,<br>disguised as a man ... </p><p>EURIPIDES, <i>THE BACCHAE</i></p><br><p>No other Greek god came into the world in quite the same way as Dionysus. His father was Zeus, whose name means "shower of light." Lord of the sky, god of the thunderbolt, Zeus was the most powerful of all the gods of Olympus. He loved women, mortal and immortal, and enjoyed many love affairs. His wife, the goddess Hera, was naturally angry and jealous. She was forever seeking revenge for Zeus's many love affairs--and a goddess scorned has fury indeed! </p><p>Born of Fire*</p><p>One day Zeus was traveling on earth. He wore a disguise, because undisguised no mortal could look at him and live. He came to Thebes, an ancient city of Greece, where he fell hopelessly in love with Semele, the daughter of King Cadmus. Their passion was great, and before long she became pregnant. </p><p>Semele wanted nothing more than to look into the true eyes of her lover. She was urged on mercilessly by her nurse--who happened to be the treacherous Hera in disguise. Finally, Semele could stand it no longer. She asked Zeus to grant her a boon. </p><p>Zeus was in a good mood, and he loved the young woman. Foolishly, he swore an unbreakable oath on the River Styx that she could have whatever she asked. </p><p>When the innocent Semele asked to see the god of the thunderbolt in his true splendor, Zeus was horrified. He knew that the sight of his godhead would mean her certain death. </p><p>"No!" he cried in anguish. "Anything but that. You do not know what you are asking for." But she persisted and Zeus sadly kept his word. As he shed his disguise and revealed his fiery radiance, the unfortunate Semele was almost completely incinerated. Only her womb, around which she had wrapped some ivy, escaped the flame. (Ivy is said to be the only thing on earth that is impervious to the splendor of god.) </p><p>Zeus was furious. Quickly, he plucked the fetus from the womb, cut an incision in his own thigh, and tucked the child into it. </p><p>The baby continued to grow in Zeus's thigh. When gestation was complete Zeus gave birth to the infant god Dionysus. </p><p>This child of fire was a brand new force to be reckoned with. Even the Titans--the powerful first gods of earth, who represented the instinctive masculine qualities--were quaking in their boots. Brutally, they tore the baby to pieces and boiled him for good measure. They weren't going to have anything like this coming into the world! </p><p>But Dionysus would not stay dead. A pomegranate tree, symbol of fertility, sprouted from the earth where a drop of his blood had fallen; and Zeus's mother, Rhea, made Dionysus whole once again. In this way the young god was born three times: once from his mortal mother's womb; once from his immortal father's thigh; and once from the wisdom of the earth, represented by his grandmother. With a start like this, one wonders what kind of a god we have on hand! </p><p>The Young God</p><p>Semele's sister Ino and her husband, Athamas, raised the baby Dionysus as a girl so that Hera would not recognize him. </p><p>But the goddess was not deceived, and in her rage she drove the aunt and uncle mad. </p><p>Zeus acted quickly. He ordered Hermes, the divine messenger, to transform Dionysus temporarily into a young goat and bring him to the beautiful Mount Nysa. There he would be raised secretly by nymphs, the joyous female spirits of the forests and mountains. </p><p>The nymphs loved their young charge. They housed him in a cave and fed him on honey. Dionysus spent his childhood gamboling freely over the mountainside, surrounded by the glories of nature and learning the sensuous pleasures of the earth. His teachers were many and varied: The Muses inspired him with poetry and music. The satyrs, half-man, half-goat, taught him the wonders of dance and exuberant sexuality. The sileni, part-horse, part-man, spirits of the springs and rivers, taught him wisdom. Silenus, the intoxicated old man who was Dionysus's predecessor, taught the young god virtue. </p><p>Dionysus passed the years happily, learning many things. Like the grapevine, which can only grow in the sun's intense heat and the moisture of the spring rain, Dionysus had been born of fire and nourished by the rains of the mountain. He understood the power of the vine perfectly, and marked his passage from childhood to young godhood by inventing the art of winemaking (some say he learned it from Silenus), which would bring humanity so much potential joy and desperation. </p><p>At last Dionysus stood revealed as a god. This was just what the ever-vengeful Hera had been waiting for. Recognizing Dionysus at last, she cursed him with madness. </p><p>The Travels of Dionysus</p><p>The raving Dionysus left his home on Mount Nysa and began to travel the world. Mad as he was, Dionysus was still a powerful god. Wherever he went he spread the art of winemaking and his own worship. </p><p>He was accompanied by a startling array of followers: His tutor, the fat old drunkard Silenus, rode precariously on a donkey; grinning satyrs, joyous nymphs, prancing centaurs, and other woodland spirits capered and danced alongside. For human followers he had the Maenads. These wild women of the mountains, initiates of the ancient women's mysteries, worshiped their god with singing, dancing, and bloody feasts. Together, they cut a swath of wild and joyous celebration across the ancient world. </p><p>In time Rhea purified the young god of his madness and initiated him into her mysteries, the very secret women's mysteries. The power of Dionysus was then unparalleled. . .</p><p>*The story of Dionysus has been told for thousands of years. There will naturally be changes from retelling to retelling.</p></p><h2>It&#39;s a Bird</h2><p>As comic writer Steve explores the myth and meaning of Superman for an undesireable assignment, he finds himself delving into some secrets of his own family along the way.</p><p>Steven T. Seagle is an American writer who works in the comic book, television, film, live theater, video game and animation industries. He is best known for his nationally acclaimed graphic novel memoir IT'S A BIRD...&nbsp;and as part of his Man of Action Studios (with Duncan Rouleau, Joe Casey and Joe Kelly) which created the animated Cartoon Network series <i>Ben 10</i>.The first rule of metafiction: stories about how the author can't think of what to write about are a bad idea. So a story about a comics writer named Steve who's been assigned to write <i>Superman</i> comics but can't come up with a way to write them seems unpromising. (Seagle wrote the <i>Superman</i>comic for several years.) But Seagle and artist Kristiansen (with whom he collaborated on a couple of excellent <i>House of Secrets</i> books) come through. This isn't a Superman story, exactly; it's an experimental, refracted, semifictional memoir, with Superman-or, rather, the variety of ideas that Superman represents-as its central symbol. Kristiansen's inventive ink-and-watercolor artwork, a bit reminiscent of the Expressionist painter Egon Schiele, gives a crisp, arty look to the sections about Steve's progressively more messed-up personal life and family secret. (The latter has to do with Huntington's disease, the discussion of which here approaches Very Special Episode territory.) Both writer and artist shine on the sections that explore Steve's thoughts about what Superman means: Nietzschean �bermensch, synthesizer of primary colors' symbolism, embodiment of benevolent violence, alien who's accepted where others aren't, etc. Kristiansen devises a distinct visual technique for each, often inspired by other 20th-century painters. It's a sweet, clever meditation on what makes the concept of Superman so powerful, and the troubled relationship between powerful concepts and creative narrative.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

They show how different cultures at different times have entwined physical capacities and mental mechanisms in order to construct a body adapted to moral ideas or social circumstances the body of a charismatic citizen or a visionary monk a mirror image of the world or a reflection of the spirit. Each volume emphasizes a particular perspective. Part 1 explores the human body&#39;s relationship to the divine, to the bestial, and to the machines that imitate or simulate it. Part 2 covers the junctures between the body&#39;s &#34;outside&#34; and &#34;inside&#34; by studying the manifestations - or production - of the soul and the expression of the emotions and, on another level, by examining the speculations inspired by cenesthesia, pain, and death. Part 3 brings into play the classical opposition between organ and function by showing how organs or bodily substances can be used to justify or challenge the way human societies function and, conversely, how political and social functions tend to make the bodies of the persons filling them the organs of a larger body - the social body or the universe as a whole.ContributorsMark Elvin, Catherine Gallagher, Fran�oise H�ritier Aug�, Julia Kristeva, William R.

In this hardcover volume not only includes content from John's sermon transcripts, but also a foreword and commentary written by his son, Joel; the principles of this "no limits" faith come alive again for a new generation. <br>For the moments of struggle and temptation that every man faces, and the times in life when he feels surrounded and under attack, John's message is profoundly simple-those moments are precisely the time for an unwavering faith. In this book, John schools today's believers in seven qualities of unwavering faith:<br>1. It hears and sees what the world cannot see or hear.<br>2. It prays earnestly even though it has already heard the answer.<br>3. It is strong when there is no evidence of the answer.<br>4. It always says, "Go Again!"<br>5. It goes on when there's just a little evidence.<br>6. It believes for the big when it sees the little.<br>7. It begins with nothing but ends up doing mighty things for God.<br>Osteen also provides principles for those times when faith doesn't seem to be working. BECOMING A MAN OF UNWAVERING FAITH is a guidebook to stronger faith, from a man who spent a lifetime testing its limits.</p><p>The late <strong>John Osteen</strong> served as a pastor, evangelist, author, and teacher for 60 years.

Adler is Chairman of the Board of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, Director of the Institute for Philosophical Research, and Honorary Trustee of the Aspen Institute.&nbsp; He has authored fifty books.&nbsp; He lives in Chicago.An often profound, if sometimes tedious, discourse on the four dimensions of philosophy--the ``metaphysical,'' the ``moral,'' the ``objective,'' and the ``categorical''--by the vastly prolific, 91- year-old Adler. In his 53rd book, Adler (Chairman of the Board of Editors of the Encyclopaedia Britannica; A Second Look in the Rearview Mirror, 1992, etc.) attempts to answer such questions as: ``What is the scope of the philosophical enterprise?''; ``What is its method?''; ``What are the criteria of excellence in philosophical work?'' The author extensively examines how philosophy relates to and differs from other intellectual disciplines, such as science and history. Arguing that ``philosophy is everybody's business,'' he makes a strong case that, of all the disciplines, only philosophy is truly contemplative and ``reflexive'' enough to challenge the highest qualities of the human mind and spirit. Moving to the defensive, Adler attempts to explain why philosophy is generally regarded as pragmatically inferior to science. He contends that philosophy has been confused with archaic scientific and religious inquiry, and that in modern times it ``has been suffering from the cultural preeminence of science.'' While highly critical of 20th-century philosophy, as well as of modern efforts to reform it, the author promises a brighter future for philosophy as soon as we learn to ``preserve, consolidate and enhance'' those more positive features of it that can affect our society in a practical way. He argues that philosophy deserves more respect for the potential role it can play in education, as well as in ``the hierarchy of elements that constitute culture and civilization.'' The book--which Adler hints may be his last--concludes with an outline of a wide spectrum of philosophical topics and subjects, ranging from God to wealth. Erudite and richly contemplative--but Adler's belabored prose style may deter many. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Based on more than 700 recorded conversations, including interviews with all of King&#39;s closest surviving associates, this is a powerful portrait of King and the movement for which he dedicated himself.</p><p>In this 1987 Pulitzer Prize winner, David J. Garrow, through extensive interviews, and access to F.B.I. transcripts, delves deeply into both Dr. Martin Luther King&#x2019;s leadership role and his private life. He attributes King's moral and physical courage to his religious faith: King believed that he had literally been called to do the Lord's work. But from 1965, when the F.B.I. taped King in sexual encounters and sent the tape to S.C.L.L. headquarters, his associates noted a "spiritual depression", even a "death wish." Fear that exposure would ruin his public work dogged him until his assassination in 1968. While documenting the F.B.I.'s dirty tricks, Garrow never loses sight of King's achievement and vision, nor of the poignancy of King's belief that "the cross is something that you bear and ultimately that you die on."e Pulitzer Prize.

Night</h2><p>Provides a glittering odyssey through the glamorous dance scene in fashionable Los Angeles, offering a close-up look at the dancers, music, nightlife, hot dance spots, celebrities, and more.</p><p><i>Two by Two</i> is a whirlwind tour of the Los Angeles dancing scene by Eve Babitz, who has made a career of delineating the social comedies of L.A. Here, in a series of loosely connected chapters, she talks with instructors of various forms of social dance--including tango, salsa, country two-step, and both East and West Coast swing--about why dancing has become so popular again, even with all the difficulties of learning the steps. The story does not so much progress in a linear direction as it orbits around a shifting core, propelled by the occasionally sparkling dialogue. Apart from a sharply unexpected dose of reality in the book's epilogue, <i>Two by Two</i> occupies a pleasantly hazy daydream that, while it may or may not inspire you to hit the dance floor, reveals the charms that Babitz and her friends have found there.Forget Arthur Murray, or those dreaded dance classes your mother made you take. Two by Two is a fast-paced swirl through the dancing scene in L.A., where Leonardo DiCaprio has been known to swing at The Derby and Sandra Bullock salsas at El Floridita. Eve Babitz, a writer known for her hip, off-the-cuff, idiosyncratic style, spends two years of her life, ruins nine pairs of shoes, and goes through countless dance partners learning to appreciate and master all the hot dances from foxtrot and two-step to lindy, tango, salsa, and swing. Along the way she meets obsessed dancers and listens night after night as they pour out the secrets of their style -- who the best teachers are, where to find the perfect dancing shoes, and how to fall in love with your partner.<p>Though the entire country is engaged in this dance revival, the L.A. scene is particularly alive, Babitz finds, because there have always been people in Los Angeles who insist on going out and being "in the scene", and plenty of music, charm, colorful groups of people, and adventure to lure them. She attributes the dance craze to the fact that singles bars died when people sobered up and realized just how abysmal that scene was. Drawn by the vivacious and electric dance scene, people now meet others who come for lessons, and immediately embrace the ambition to be as one with the music, the night, and someone, maybe you.</p><p>Eve brings the flirtatious energy of dancing alive like no other writer. She describes salsa as "a dance of contradictions". "On the one hand, you want to 'be small, ' as people who lead you will say if your steps are too big. But on the other hand, you want to stagger your competition by the immensity of yourintensity. You want your own smoldering pride and divine fire to consume the room, and yet you want to hardly move". Two by Two is not a book that teaches you how to dance, but it will surely make you want to learn once you've read it.</p></p><h2>Expresate Holt Spanish 1 (Texas Teacher&#39;s Edition) (English and Spanish Edition)</h2><p>Expr�sate employs instructional and multisensorial learning techniques that connect students to Spanish-speaking countries, their arts, culture and people, while teaching them to converse in Spanish. Students learning Spanish with Expr�sate s new curriculum will be immersed in Spanish culture and real-life stories, making instruction and practice more meaningful and effective. Every chapter of Expr�sate addresses three modes of communication identified by the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL): presentational, interpretive, and interpersonal. Emphasis on these standards helps students hone their speaking skills and develop a greater grasp of the Spanish language. In addition, each Comunicacion activity in the text corresponds to expanded suggestions in the Teacher&#39;s Edition of the curriculum. Grammar is also emphasized in a new way; in Expresate, Spanish grammar is presented along with English grammar rules. These comparisons give students a stronger foundation for learning the language and its structure. The teacher support materials developed by Holt save teachers implementation time and address diversity in the classroom. Expresate lesson plans are set up for 50 or 90-minute classes and include pacing guides for block schedules or traditional schedules. Success strategies give teachers ideas for working in groups or with individual students. The teacher guide also includes strategies for differentiating instruction for advanced or special-needs learners, independent study, and Advanced Placement Exam preparation.</p><p></p><h2>Anthony Eden : A Biography</h2><p>Eden was Neville Chamberlain&#39;s foreign secretary in the 1930s, held the same position under Churchill during World War II and succeeded the latter as prime minister in 1955.

A System of Logic is the first major installment of his comprehensive restatement of an empiricist and utilitarian position. It begins the attack on &#34;intuitionism&#34; which Mill carried on throughout his life, and makes plain his belief that social planning and political action should rely primarily on scientific knowledge, not on authority, custom, revelation, or prescription.</p><p>In this two-volume work of 1843, John Stuart Mill (1806-73) establishes the principles of inductive reasoning and experimental method that inform his later works of political and social philosophy. Volume 2 includes Book VI, &#39;On the Logic of the Moral Sciences&#39;, an important early treatment of social science.John Stuart Mill was an English philosopher, politician and economist most famous for his contributions to the theory of utilitarianism. The author of numerous influential political treatises, Mill s writings on liberty, freedom of speech, democracy and economics have helped to form the foundation of modern liberal thought. His 1859 work, On Liberty, is particularly noteworthy for helping to address the nature and limits of the power of the state over the individual. Mills has become one of the most influential figures in nineteenth-century philosophy, and his writings are still widely studied and analyzed by scholars.

Here, whooping cough threatens George&#x2019;s life, yet the disease will be the key to his future. Unable to work in the fields, he spends his days studying plants. His desire for knowledge leads him to the rich farmlands of Iowa, where he becomes the first black student and later the first black faculty member at the state university. Carver pioneers hundreds of new uses for plants and revolutionizes American agriculture by teaching farmers the value of rotating cotton with nitrogen-rich crops. Cheryl Harness&#x2019; lively narrative follows Carver&#x2019;s rise to international fame: our hero dines at the White House, works with Henry Ford, and testifies to Congress.

She has won multiple awards and now lives in her historic hometown of Independence, MO. Visit Cheryl Harness at her Web site: www.cherylharness.comGrade 4&#x2013;8&#x2014;Harness presents Carver as a man who, regardless of constant hardship and racial prejudice, persevered to become a beloved teacher and devoted scientist. From the beginning, she puts his life in historical context by looking at the effects of racism on his career choices and by talking about the achievements and beliefs of his contemporaries, many of whom he knew. The author raises challenging questions throughout, especially when she discusses debates over whether Carver was truly a great scientist or more a public thinker who promoted science to help better understand the world. The lively prose style conveys his sense of passion and adventure about the man and his intellectual pursuits, and the simple black-and-white drawings add a further sense of drama. This is not just a good choice for biography assignments; it's also a strong recommendation for a nonfiction read-aloud and as a way to interest fiction readers in biography.&#x2014;<i>Michael Santangelo, Brooklyn Public Library, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I was eight and five-sixths. My audience was a pack of nine-year-olds, who were jeering at me and baying, &#x201c;Chee-eese! Chee-eese!&#x201d; I kept climbing the steps, despite the feelings of humiliation and fear. But above all, I was bewildered. How had I managed to attract so much attention? What had I done to provoke this aggression? And . . . how on earth did they know that my family surname had once been Cheese?<br><br>As Matron &#x201c;Fishy&#x201d; Findlater gave me the customary new-boy physical examination, I tried to gather my thoughts. My parents had always warned me to keep away from &#x201c;nasty rough boys.&#x201d; What, then, were they doing at a nice school like St. Peter&#x2019;s? And how was I supposed to avoid them?<br><br>Much of my predicament was that I was not just a little boy, but a very tall little boy. I was five foot three, and would pass the six-foot mark before I was twelve. So it was hard to fade away into the background, as I often wished to&#x2014;particularly later when I&#x2019;d become taller than any of the masters. It didn&#x2019;t help that one of them, Mr. Bartlett, always referred to me as &#x201c;a prominent citizen.&#x201d;<br><br>In addition, as a result of my excessive height, I had &#x201c;outgrown my strength,&#x201d; and my physical weakness meant that I was uncoordinated and awkward; so much so that a few years later my PE teacher, Captain Lancaster, was to describe me as &#x201c;six foot of chewed string.&#x201d; Add to that the fact that I had had no previous experience of the feral nature of gangs of young boys, and you will understand why my face bore the expression of an authentic coward as &#x201c;Fishy&#x201d; opened the door and coaxed me out towards my second public appearance. <br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, it&#x2019;s only teasing,&#x201d; she said. What consolation was that? You could have said the same at Nuremberg. But at least the chanting had stopped, and now there was an expectant silence as I forced myself down the stairs.&nbsp; Then... <br><br>&#x201c;Are you a Roundhead or a Cavalier?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; <br><br>Faces were thrust at me, each one of them demanding, &#x201c;Round�head or Cavalier?&#x201d; What were they talking about? <br><br>Had I understood the question, I would almost certainly have fainted, such a delicate little flower was I. (And perhaps I should explain to the more delicately nurtured that I was not being asked to offer my considered views on the relative merits of the opposing forces in the English Civil War, but to reveal whether or not I had been circumcised.) However, my first day at prep school was not a total failure. By the time I got home I had learned the meaning of two new words&#x2014;&#x201c;pathetic&#x201d; and &#x201c;wet&#x201d;&#x2014;though I had to find Dad&#x2019;s dictionary to look up &#x201c;sissy.&#x201d; <br><br>Why was I so . . . ineffectual? Well, let&#x2019;s begin at my beginning. I was born on October 27, 1939, in Uphill, a little village south of Weston-super-Mare, and separated from it by the mere width of a road which led inland from the Weston seafront. My first memory, though, is not of Uphill but of a tree in the village of Brent Knoll, a few miles away, under whose shade I recall lying, while I looked through its branches to the bright blue sky above. The sunlight is catching the leaves at different angles, so that my eye flickers from one patch of colour to the next, the verdant foliage displaying a host of verdant hues. (I thought I would try to get &#x201c;verdant,&#x201d; &#x201c;hues&#x201d; and &#x201c;foliage&#x201d; into this paragraph, as my English teachers always believed that they were signs of creative talent. Though I probably shouldn&#x2019;t have used &#x201c;verdant&#x201d; twice.) <br><br>Of course, I&#x2019;m not <i>sure </i>it is my first memory; I&#x2019;m sure I used to <i>think </i>it was; and I <i>like </i>to think it was, too, because it would make sense, baby me lying in a pram, contentedly watching the interplay of the glinting verdant foliage and its beautiful hues. <br>One thing I do know for certain, though, is that shortly before this incident with the tree, the Germans bombed Weston-super-Mare. I&#x2019;ll just repeat that... <br>On August 14, 1940, German planes bombed Weston-super-Mare. This is verifiable: it was in all the papers. Especially the <i>Weston Mer�cury</i>. Most Westonians were confident the raid had been a mistake. The Germans were a people famous for their efficiency, so why would they drop perfectly good bombs on Weston-super-Mare, when there was nothing in Weston that a bomb could destroy that could possibly be as valuable as the bomb that destroyed it? That would mean that every explosion would make a tiny dent in the German economy. <br><br>The Germans did return, however, and several times, which mys�tified everyone. Nevertheless I can&#x2019;t help thinking that Westonians actually quite liked being bombed: it gave them a sense of signifi�cance that was otherwise lacking from their lives. But that still leaves the question <i>why </i>would the Hun have bothered? Was it just Teutonic <i>joie de vivre</i>? Did the Luftwaffe pilots mistake the Weston seafront for the Western Front? I have heard it quite seriously put forward by older Westonians that it was done at the behest of William Joyce, the infamous &#x201c;Lord Haw-Haw,&#x201d; who was hanged as a traitor in 1944 by the British for making Nazi propaganda radio broadcasts to Britain during the war. When I asked these amateur historians why a man of Irish descent who was born in Brooklyn would have such an animus against Weston that he would buttonhole Hitler on the matter, they fell silent. I prefer to believe that it was because of a grudge held by Reichsmarschall Hermann Goering on account of an unsavoury in�cident on Weston pier in the 1920s, probably involving No�l Coward and Terence Rattigan. <br><br>My father&#x2019;s explanation, however, makes the most sense: he said the Germans bombed Weston to show that they really do have a sense of humour. <br><br>Whatever the truth of the matter, two days after that first raid we had moved to a quaint little Somerset village called Brent Knoll. Dad had had quite enough of big bangs during his four years in the trenches in France, and since he was up to nothing in Weston that was vital to the war effort, he spent the day after the bombing driv�ing around the countryside near Weston until he found a small farm�house, owned by a Mr. and Mrs. Raffle, who agreed to take the Cleese family on as paying guests. I love the fact that he didn&#x2019;t <i>mess around</i>. We were out of there! And it was typically smart of him to find a farm, where, at a time of strict rationing, an egg or a chicken or even a small pig could go missing without attracting too much attention. <br><br>Mother told me once that some Westonians privately criticised Dad for retreating so soon. They apparently felt it would have been more dignified to have waited a week or so before running away. I think this view misses the essential point of running away, which is to do it the moment the idea has occurred to you. Only an obses�sional procrastinator would cry, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s run for our lives, but not till Wednesday afternoon.&#x201d; <br><br>Back to the tree. I revisited the farm many years later, and, just as I thought I remembered, there was a huge chestnut tree in the middle of the front lawn, under which I might easily have lain in a pram. In 1940 the farmhouse had been one of a row of houses of me�dium size strung along a road, with fields opposite; it didn&#x2019;t look very farm-like from the front, but when you walked up the drive and got to the back of the house you saw there was a proper farmyard, with mud and chickens and rusty farm equipment and ferrets in cages and rabbits in wooden hutches.<br><br>And it was this location that provides my second memory. (It must come after the first because in it I am now standing up.) I was bitten by a rabbit. <br><br>Or rather, I was nibbled by a rabbit, but, because I was such a weedy, namby-pamby little pansy, I reacted as though I&#x2019;d lost a limb. It was the sheer unfairness of it all that so upset me. One minute, I was saying, &#x201c;Hello, Mr. Bunny!&#x201d; and smiling at its sweet little face and funny floppy ears. The next, the fucker savaged me. It seemed so gratuitous. What, I asked myself, had I done to the rabbit to deserve this psychotic response? <br><br>The more pertinent question, though, is: why was I such a <i>wuss</i>? And the obvious answer is that it&#x2019;s because I was the only child of older, over-protective parents. I have a memory (No. 3) to support this. I&#x2019;m now about three and am in the Red Cow Inn, the hub and beating heart of Brent Knoll. Somehow I bang my hand, and just before I burst into tears, I hold it up to my father and howl, &#x201c;Daddy, look! I&#x2019;ve hurt my precious thumb!&#x201d; This, to my astonishment, gets a big laugh. Is my thumb <i>not </i>precious, I wonder? Dad certainly thinks it is. When the occasion demands, he always says, &#x201c;Oh, you&#x2019;ve hurt your precious &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; [fill in applicable body part].&#x201d; <br><br>I hesitate to criticise Dad, because what sanity I have I owe to his loving kindness. But there&#x2019;s no doubt that he did pamper me, and such early coddling was one of the reasons I embarked on a wussy lifestyle. Throughout my schoolboy days I never felt very manly, or strong, or virile, or vigorous, or healthily aggressive. At school I avoided playground &#x201c;gangs,&#x201d; because I didn&#x2019;t understand why anyone would want to behave like that. I loved ball games, but was always appalled at how rough, for example, rugby looked, even at the safe distance I kept while pretending to play it. When I was seventeen, my assistant Clifton College housemaster, Alec MacDonald, finally took me to task for funking tackles. Describing my efforts as &#x201c;danc�ing around like a disabled fairy,&#x201d; he ordered me to watch while he gave a demonstration of how to tackle properly. He asked a member of the first XV, Tony Rogers, to run at him. He closed in on Rogers, and then went in hard, just as Rogers tried to sidestep him. The result was that the top of Mr. MacDonald&#x2019;s head came into sharp contact with Rogers&#x2019; right hip. Mr. MacDonald was unavailable for teaching later that afternoon; indeed he did not reappear for forty-eight hours. When he did, I was too cowardly to remind him that he had specifi�cally told me that &#x201c;if you go in hard, you never get hurt.&#x201d; So when I see international rugby teams lumbering out at Twickenham, I look at them with awe, but also with a sense of being genetically discon�nected from them. I was not born to be butch, and I have accepted my innate unmanliness without complaint. Besides, it seems to me that cowards very seldom cause trouble, which is probably why there is a history of them being shot by people who do.[1] <br><br>None of this, incidentally, is to say that my infant wussiness was in any way admirable. But while I was undeniably a gutless little weed there was an upside: at least I didn&#x2019;t display the habitual mind�less aggression of some young males. Better a wuss than a psycho, I say, and I am proud that I have never been able to force myself to watch cage fighting. <br>If part of my weedy outlook on life came from my father&#x2019;s pam�pering, a fair proportion was down to my complicated relationship with my mother. And in this context another early memory comes to mind. I am lying in bed, falling asleep, when a noise causes me to turn and see shadows moving on the half-open door of my bedroom. They are shadows of my parents fighting. Dad has been coming into my room and Mum has started attacking him, pummelling him with a flurry of blows which he is trying to fend off. There is no sound&#x2014;I sense they are both trying not to wake me&#x2014;and the memory has no emotion attached, although it is very clear. Just the shadows which last a few seconds and then . . . silence. As I write this, my throat tightens a little. The level of violence I&#x2019;m describing is low: there are no shillelaghs or chainsaws here, just lower-middle-class fisticuffs, with no prospect of Grievous Bodily Harm, as English law calls it. Nevertheless, my beloved dad, a kind and decent person, is being at�tacked by this unknowable creature who is widely rumoured to be my mother. <br><br>Young children have so little life experience that they inevitably assume that what happens around and to them is the norm. I re�member that when my daughter Cynthia was very young she was surprised to discover that some of her friends&#x2019; fathers did not work in television. So it would have been hard for me to describe my rela�tionship with my mother as problematic because I had no idea what the word &#x201c;motherly&#x201d; conveyed to most people. Dad once described to me how, during the First World War, he had witnessed a wounded soldier lying in a trench and crying out for his mother. &#x201c;Why on earth would he cry for her?&#x201d; I wondered. When, over the years, I began to hear friends tell me that their mother was their best friend, someone with whom they routinely discussed their daily life, and to whom they looked for emotional support, I simply thought, &#x201c;How wonderful that must be...&#x201d; <br>Please do not think that I am loftily labeling her a &#x201c;bad mother.&#x201d; In many ways she was a good mother; sometimes a very good mother. In all day-to-day matters she was extremely diligent: preparing good meals, making sure I was properly clothed and shod and warm and dry, keeping the house neat and clean, and fiercely protective of me. Under light hypnosis, I once recalled a German air raid, with the sound of the bombers not far away, and Mother throwing herself on top of me, under a big kitchen table. If it was a false memory, it&#x2019;s still what she would have done.<br><br>From a practical point of view, then, she was impeccable. But she was also self-obsessed and anxious, and that could make life with her very uncomfortable indeed.<br>A clue to her self-obsession, I always felt, was her extraordinary lack of general knowledge. On one of her visits to London in the late &#x2019;80s, a salad was prepared for lunch which contained quails&#x2019; eggs. She asked what kind of eggs they were and I explained that they were moles&#x2019; eggs, and that when we wanted them, we would go up to Hampstead Heath very early in the morning, as moles laid them at the entrance to their burrows during the night, collect the eggs and make sure we ate them the same day before they had time to hatch. She listened with great attention, as my family&#x2019;s jaws sagged, and said she thought them &#x201c;delicious.&#x201d; Later that day she caught a men�tion of Mary, Queen of Scots. She recognised the name and asked me who this was. With my family listening, I pushed the envelope a little, telling her that Mary was a champion Glaswegian darts player who had been killed in the Blitz. &#x201c;What a shame,&#x201d; she said. <br><br>I was being a bit naughty, of course, but I also wanted to prove to my family the truth of a comment I had made earlier about Mother, which they had not accepted on first hearing. I had told them that <i>she had no information about anything that was not going to affect her life directly in the immediate future; </i>and that consequently she possessed no general knowledge&#x2014;and when I said no general knowledge, I didn&#x2019;t mean very, very little. Naturally they had thought I was exaggerating. <br><br>And the reason for this was not that she was unintelligent, but that she lived her life in such a constant state of high anxiety, border�ing on incipient panic, that she could focus only on the t...</p><h2>Letters to Star Trek</h2><p>This is a First Edition,soft cover, edited by Susan Sackett with an introduction by Gene Roddenberry.

Here, too, we see devoted teachers in a good but underfunded public elementary school that manages, against all odds, to be a warm, inviting, and protective place; and we see the children also in the intimate religious setting of a church in which they are watched over by the vigilant grandmothers of the neighborhood and by a priest whose ministry is, first and foremost, to the very young.<br><br>A work of guarded optimism that avoids polemic and the fevered ideologies of partisan debate, <b>Ordinary Resurrections</b> is a book about the little miracles of stubbornly persistent innocence in children who are still unsoiled by the world and still can view their place within it without cynicism or despair. Sometimes playful, sometimes jubilantly funny, and sometimes profoundly sad, they're sensitive children, by and large -- complex and morally insightful -- and their ethical vitality denounces and subverts the racially charged labels that the world of grown-up expertise too frequently assigns to them.<br><br>The author's personal involvement with specific children deepens as the narrative evolves. A Jewish man, now 63 years old, he finds his own religious speculations growing interwoven with the moral and religious explorations of the children, some of whom have been his friends for nearly seven years. The children change, of course, from year to year as they learn more about the world; but the author is changed also by the generous and tender ways in which the children, step by step, unlock their secrets and unveil the mysteries of their belief to him.<br><br>Salvation in these stories comes not from the promises of politicians or the claims of sociology but from the ordinary resurrections that take place routinely in the hearts of children. "We all lie down," a theologian tells the author. "We all rise up. We do this every day." So, too, when given a fair chance, do many of the undervalued urban children of our nation. In this book, we see some beautiful children as they rise, and rise again.</p><p>Stepping back from his 30-year attack on the inequalities of education, Jonathan Kozol allows the children to speak for themselves in <i>Ordinary Resurrections</i>. These are the schoolchildren of South Bronx's most dismal neighborhood, Mott Haven, where social struggles with poverty and imprisoned fathers rate just under AIDS and asthma as the greatest threats to young lives. Yet, Kozol marvels, despair and bitterness don't come to mind when you meet 10-year-olds like Ariel, who "skips through life" and displays a healing tenderness to others at the church afterschool program that has become a living laboratory of sorts for Kozol since he wrote <i>Savage Inequalities</i> in 1996. This is "not the land of bad statistics but the land of licorice sticks and long division, candy bars and pencil sets," he writes. In recording conversations between these kids and each other, their teachers, caretakers, parents, and even himself, Kozol manages to move the adults to the periphery in order to let the children teach. There is no government data, no research conclusions, only a sense of hope and wonder at the resiliency of the young.<p> Kozol readily admits that he's due for a reflective moment. In his 60s, living alone, his parents seriously ill, he seeks safety in surrounding himself with children. He confesses that he's not a religious man, yet he finds himself overcoming his awkwardness with prayer, even bowing his head with the children at times. His writing in this moving account is among his most eloquent, as when he describes the gentle way in which a teacher tugs for the attention of a dreamy first-grader as if carefully unwrapping a small package that may be breakable. He captures the rhythm of the exchanges between teacher and student in a way that practically whispers to the reader. Ultimately, this is a book about healing that reveals more about the lives of children in poor neighborhoods--and Kozol--than any of his prizewinning books to date. <i>--Jodi Mailander Farrell</i></p>"<b>Ordinary Resurrections</b> is a deeply moving and marvelous book. Jonathan Kozol has shared poetic and powerful stories of the poor children of Mott Haven who became a part of his life.

Given "the sinister events in its memory," Celan believed that the language of poetry had to become "more sober, more factual . . . &#x2018;grayer.'" Abandoning the more sumptuous music of the first books, he pared down his compositions to increase the accuracy of the language that now "does not transfigure or render &#x2018;poetical'; it names, it posits, it tries to measure the area of the given and the possible." In his need for an inhabitable post-Holocaust world, Celan saw that "reality is not simply there; it must be searched for and won." </p><br><p> <i>Breathturn into Timestead</i> reveals a poet undergoing a profound artistic reinvention. The work is that of a witness and a visionary.</p></p><p><p><b>Paul Celan</b> was born in Czernowitz, Bukovina, in 1920, and is widely considered to be one of the most innovative poets of the twentieth century. A German-speaking Jew, he was sent to a forced labor camp during World War II. Celan settled in Paris in 1948, where he lived and wrote until his suicide in 1970. </p><p><b>Pierre Joris </b>has written, edited, and translated more than fifty books, including poetry, essays, translations, and anthologies. Most recently he published <i>Barzakh: Poems 2000-2012</i>, <i>Meditations on the Stations of Mansur al-Hallaj,</i> and the fourth volume of the anthology <i>Poems for the Millennium: The University of California Book of North African Literature</i>. In 2005 he received the PEN Award for Poetry in Translation for his translation of Celan's <i>Lichtzwang / Lightduress</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;I will make the outrageous assertion that Paul Celan reinvented poetry&#x2015;or invented a new kind of poetry&#x2015;or took poetry to a place where it had never been before. By definition, such work cannot be translated. Then along comes Pierre Joris, and by some mysterious process of linguistic alchemy, he has managed to translate hundreds of examples of this work, or at least to produce versions that embody the strangeness and power of the originals&#x2015;and the grand adventure of Celan's late poems lives on in English.&#x201d; &#x2015;Paul Auster</p><p>&#x201c;More than a monumental work of scholarship, Pierre Joris&#x2019;s 40-year project in translation of the later poetry of one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most original and &#x201c;untranslatable&#x201d; poets is an extraordinary work of poetry in contemporary English. With seeming ease, Joris conveys the complexity and inventiveness of the original German without oversimplifying or domesticating its difficulty, its dark beauty, or the depth of its ideas. His commentary is also of great value in illuminating the background, sources and meanings of Celan&#x2019;s singular voice." &#x2015;Judges' citation, 2015 National Translation Award in Poetry</p><p>&#x201c;*Starred Review* Hard to forget and harder to interpret, the dense and astonishing poems of Paul Celan (1920-1970) stand near the center of postwar European letters, and of Jewish writing after the Holocaust. This first appearance in English of the complete late volumes arrives thanks to a poet well suited to the task. Joris, a celebrated and prolific Luxembourger-American writer, has been translating Celan since 1967 and here finds beautiful--or terrifying--correlates for Celan's wrenched and recombinant speech. Celan, raised amid many languages, spoke German at home. The Nazis killed his parents and held the poet in a labor camp until the end of the war. Celan settled in Paris, but wrote his poems in German. The later poems--six books, three of them posthumous--comprise new compounds, alienated images, hauntingly crystallized phrases that sound like nobody's native tongue: critics find in them responses to the Holocaust, an "excavated heart," a civilization beyond repair. To read Joris's Celan is to see not only the insights and the horrors, but also intimacy, sexual jealousy, irony, even humor and hope. The exemplary en face edition also presents all the German; Joris provides a careful introduction and ample, learned notes.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;Paul Celan was a celebrated translator and a poet recognized as one of the twentieth century's greatest writers in German, alongside Rainer Maria Rilke. Celan's work is defined by his experiences during WWII, including segregation into a Romanian ghetto, the deportation and death of his parents, and imprisonment in a Nazi labor camp. While Celan's early work is characterized by lyrically complex and emotionally intense verse, the tone and tenor of his poetry shifted dramatically as he moved away from the immediacy of wartime memories and began to write out of an urgency to reinvent his mother tongue through enigmatic lines and German neologisms. Nearly every page of this comprehensive bilingual edition includes wild, bewildering jewels: 'Down melancholy's rapids / past the blank woundmirror: There the forty / stripped lifetrees are rafted,' and 'the bloodsugar-pea, x-rayable / by fingernails, / rotates.' Such odd, disorienting turns make for page after page of challenging poetry, and master translator Joris's extensive introduction and commentary provide vital context for readers less familiar with Celan's linguistic audacity. A priceless compendium.&#x201d; &#x2015;Diego B�ez<i>, Booklist</i></p><p>&#x201c;No twentieth-century poet pierces the heart of language with such an exquisite blade as Paul Celan.

Indeed, despite pronounced disadvantages in firepower and mobility, the Communist Vietnamese endeavored to crush South Vietnam and expel the American military with a strategy predicated on "big unit" war. Orchestrated by a militant clique in Hanoi, the "big unit" war was designed to yield a quick and decisive victory over South Vietnam. Exploiting an extensive array of Communist Vietnamese sources, including seldom utilized unit histories and battle studies, <i>Grab Them by Their Belts</i> chronicles in rich detail the formation, development, and participation of the Viet Cong in the opening stanza of the Communist big unit war against the Americans, and how the ultimate failure of that war profoundly influenced the decision to launch the Tet Offensive. <br><p><i>Grab Them by their Belts</i>, unlike much of the existing body English literature on the Vietnam War, mined the expansive Communist historiography on the conflict to craft an authentic and accurate account of the big unit war from a Communist perspective. Communist memoirs, unit histories, and battlefield studies were extensively consulted to reconstruct the formation and deployment of major VC/NVA military units, battles and campaigns, and the overarching strategic debates that informed the big unit war. Additionally, <i>Grab Them by Their Belts</i> recounts how the Communist big unit war reflected the desire to crush South Vietnam quickly and decisively, and how the failure of that war influenced the decision to launch the Tet Offensive.</p></p><p>In addition to his groundbreaking study, <i>Grab Their Belts To Fight Them: The Viet Cong's Big-Unit War Against the U.S., 1965-1966</i>, Warren has written for a number of publications, including <i>Vietnam Magazine</i>, <i>Desperta Ferro</i>, and <i>The Argentina Independent</i>. Warren has also appeared on the "John Batchelor Show" and in the American Heroes Channel (formerly the Military Channel) documentary, "Warrior POV-Search and Destroy." Presently, he is finishing a book about the 4th Infantry Division in Vietnam."<i>Grab Their Belts to Fight Them</i> portrays the VC as a more complex organism than previously understood, and Wilkins's account of VC big-unit warfare between 1965 and 1966 is a necessary addition to the literature if we wish to keep learning from the Vietnam War. If nothing else, this assessment of VC fighting highlights the fact that, with the right strategic direction, seemingly unconventional armies are quite capable of fighting in a more conventional manner, whether or not they wear pajamas."<b><i> -- Air &amp; Space Power Journal</i></b></p><h2>Harley Quinn by Amanda Conner &amp; Jimmy Palmiotti Omnibus Vol. 3</h2><p><b>Harley Quinn moved to Coney Island to start a new, Joker-free life for herself, but she's not been doing it alone!

The three Johannine letters are explored first, with ample notes and reflections representing the best of contemporary and traditional scholarship and commentary. The largest portion of this volume is devoted to the Revelation to John, also called the Book of Revelation and the Apocalypse (from the Greek, meaning ''unveiling''). <p>Written in highly symbolic style, the Revelation to John is perhaps the most difficult book of the Bible to understand. Scholars have long debated whether the book is concerned mainly with a symbolic depiction of the struggle of good against evil or whether it applies to specific events in history-its own time, the general course of Church history, or the end of the world. The annotations and commentary on this volume draw on the best elements from each approach, while emphasizing the biblical author's immediate intention: to recount the heavenly vision he received as it applied to his own time. Modern scholarship, as well as insights from the Church Fathers and other classic commentators, help the reader make sense of what many people regard as a confusing book. </p><p><i>The Ignatius Catholic Study Bible</i> includes Topical Essays, Word Studies and Charts. Each page features an easy-to-use Cross-Reference Section. Study Questions are provided for each biblical book, which can be used for personal or group study of the Word of God. Each biblical book includes an introductory essay covering questions of authorship, date, destination, structure and themes. Also included are outlines of each book. </p><p>The text of the <i>Ignatius Catholic Study Bible</i> is the Revised Standard Version, Second Catholic Edition.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Running Fence Project - Christo</h2><p>Running Fence was an installation art piece by Christo and Jeanne-Claude, which was completed on September 10, 1976.

But Rei's work is interrupted by the arrival of her long-distance boyfriend, lawyer Hugh Glendinning, who is involved in a class action lawsuit on behalf of people forced to engage in slave labor for Japanese companies during World War II.<p></p><p>Suddenly, when one of Hugh's clients is murdered, their two projects intertwine. Before long, Rei uncovers troubling facts about her own family's actions during the war. As she starts to unravel the truth and search for a killer, the notions of family ties and loyalty take on an entirely new meaning.</p><p>Sujata Massey, whom critics consistently praise for her ability to balance murder and mystery with captivating cultural lore, is back with another gripping and provocative tale sure to keep readers charmed from start to finish.</p></p><p><p>Sujata Massey was a reporter for the <em>Baltimore Evening Sun</em> and spent several years in Japan teaching English and studying Japanese. She is the author of <em>The Salaryman's Wife, Zen Attitude, The Flower Master, The Floating Girl, The Bride's Kimono, The Samurai's Daughter, The Pearl Diver,</em> and <em>The Typhoon Lover</em>. She lives in Minneapolis. </p>All California-born Rei Shimura really wants is to lead her quiet life in Tokyo as an antiques dealer while learning more about her Japanese relatives, but Massey, of course, has other plans for her in this absorbing cross-cultural puzzle, the sixth in the series (after 2001's The Bride's Kimono). On her way home from Washington, D.C., Rei stops in San Francisco to spend Christmas with her parents and do some research on Japanese decorative objects, including some belonging to her family. Her Scottish boyfriend, lawyer Hugh Glendinning, is involved in a reparation case for victims who were used as slave labor by corporations during WWII. Holiday festivities take on an edge when the woman Hugh is in town to question is murdered, Rei uncovers some potentially disturbing information about her own family's role in the war and a young Japanese medical student boarding with the family disappears. All trails seem to lead to Tokyo, where Rei returns to her beloved apartment and her relatives hoping for resolution. She and Hugh, however, soon find themselves embroiled in some very nasty business leading to her deportation back to San Francisco. Massey poses some deeply resonating questions about guilt and responsibility, while Rei faces some universal truths about families, loyalty and dealing with the past no matter how unpleasant it may be. Hugh's Christmas proposal guarantees intriguing complications ahead.

Amidst a wealth of bloody sea battles, he proves himself courageous in danger and resilient intimes of trouble. <em>The Making of C. S.

Filled with in-depth interviews with the stars and crew, <em>The Making of C. S. Forester's Horatio Hornblower</em> captures the excitement and complexities of filming in its two foreign locations,the Crimea and Portugal. It contains more than 100 full-color photographs and illustrations charting all stages of production and shows exactly how navy life in the Napoleonic era was re-created through authentic costumes, makeup, sets, naval design, and special effects. It also gives an exclusive insight into the building of the <em>HMS Indefatigable</em>--a 125-foot, 22-cannon replica of a 1750s vessel, and the first British frigate to be handcrafted from wood in the last 140 years. Containing background historical information as well as on-set anecdotes and a behind-the-scenes look at key action sequences, <em>The Making of C. S. Forester's Horatio Hornblower</em> is essential reading for all of Forester's Hornblower fans.</p><p>YA-A detailed account, loaded with photographs, of the filming of the made-for-TV special.

McGregor adds enough historical background for the story to provide basic knowledge of the era and naval matters of the time. Details about the filming process, the costumes, and the major characters make up the remainder of the book. The last chapter contains a synopsis of the four episodes that make up the special production. Some of the forays into British slang and humor may give readers momentary pause, but none of them distract from the text or the content in an appreciable manner.

A few locks of dry white hair clung to his scalp, like wild flowers fighting for life on a bare rock.&#34; Published in 1939, when Raymond Chandler was 50, this is the first of the Philip Marlowe novels. Its bursts of sex, violence, and explosively direct prose changed detective fiction forever. &#34;She was trouble. She was tall and rangy and strong-looking.

The cartoons range from a scenic and graceful tree full of purple finches in a snowy village in Vermont to a manic pelican with a mouthful of loot in Louisiana. There's plenty to make children laugh: Annoyed by Delaware's Blue Hen Chicken on the facing page, Connecticut's American Robin sings, "Yankee Doodle went to town,/followed by a chicken,/if that bird won't shut his beak,/he's gonna get a lickin'." There's also plenty to amuse adults that may fly over children's heads: "Nevada produces the most gold of any state, but California already won the title of the Golden State, so Nevada settled for the silver. (The bronze went to Romania.)" Not to be confused with a reference book, this title does not provide the same type of information for each state. Each page dependably names the state bird and capital, shows a small shape map of the state, and gives its nickname. After that, it's a free-for-all.

Local newspaper editor Willie Traynor reported the details of the horrifying crime. The murderer, Danny Padgitt, was tried before a packed courthouse in Clanton, Mississippi, threatening revenge against the jurors if they co</p><p>In 1970, small town newspaper <i>The Clanton Times</i> went belly up. With financial assistance from a rich relative, it's purchased by 23-year-old Willie Traynor, formerly the paper's cub reporter. Soon afterward, his new business receives the readership boost it needs thanks to his editorial efforts and coverage of a particularly brutal rape and murder committed by the scion of the town's reclusive bootlegger family. Rather than shy from reporting on the subsequent open-and-shut trial (those who oppose the Padgitt family tend to turn up dead in the area's swampland), Traynor launches a crusade to ensure the unrepentant murderer is brought to justice. When a guilty verdict is returned, the town is relieved to find the Padgitt family's grip on the town did not sway the jury, though Danny Padgitt is sentenced to life in prison rather than death. But, when Padgitt is released after serving less than a decade in jail and members of the jury are murdered, Clanton once again finds itself at the mercy of its renegade family.<p> When it comes, the d�nouement is no surprise; <i>The Last Juror</i> is less a story of suspense than a study of the often idyllic southern town of Clanton, Mississippi (the setting for Grisham's first novel, <i>A Time to Kill</i>). Throughout the nine years between Padgitt's trial and release, Traynor finds acceptance in Clanton, where the people "don't really trust you unless they trusted your grandfather." He grows from a long-haired idealist into another of the town's colorful characters--renovating an old house, sporting a bowtie, beloved on both sides of the color line, and the only person to have attended each of the town's 88 churches at least once. <i>The Last Juror</i> returns Grisham to the courtroom where he made his name, but those who enjoyed the warm sentiment of his recent novels (<i>Bleachers</i>, <i>A Painted House</i>) will still find much to love here. <i>--Benjamin Reese</i></p>In 1970, one of Mississippi's more colorful weekly newspapers, "The Ford County Times, went bankrupt. To the surprise and dismay of many, ownership was assumed by a 23 year-old college dropout, named Willie Traynor. The future of the paper looked grim until a young mother was brutally raped and murdered by a member of the notorious Padgitt family. Willie Traynor reported all the gruesome details, and his newspaper began to prosper. <br>The murderer, Danny Padgitt, was tried before a packed courthouse in Clanton, Mississippi. The trial came to a startling and dramatic end when the defendant threatened revenge against the jurors if they convicted him. Nevertheless, they found him guilty, and he was sentenced to life in prison. <br>But in Mississippi in 1970, "life" didn't necessarily mean "life," and nine years later Danny Padgitt managed to get himself paroled.

They conducted their experiments through art and polemic, manifesto and demonstration, love and politics. But it was above all through game-playing that they sought to subvert academic modes of inquiry and undermine the complacent certainties of the bourgeoisie. <br><br> Surrealist games is a delightful compendium that allows the reader to enjoy firsthand the methodologies of the Surreal, with their amazing swings between the verbal and the visual, the beautiful and the grotesque. <br><br>It is also a box of games to play for fun: poetic, imaginative, revelatory, full of possibilities for unlocking the door to the unconscious and releasing the poetry of collective creativity.

Why is it that the age of globalization is accompanied by a no less global epidemic of nostalgia? Can we know what we are nostalgic for? In the seventeenth century, Swiss doctors believed that opium, leeches, and a trek through the Alps would cure nostalgia. In 1733 a Russian commander, disgusted with the debilitating homesickness rampant among his troops, buried a soldier alive as a deterrent to nostalgia. In her new book, Svetlana Boym develops a comprehensive approach to this elusive ailment. Combining personal memoir, philosophical essay, and historical analysis, Boym explores the spaces of collective nostalgia that connect national biography and personal self-fashioning in the twenty-first century. She guides us through the ruins and construction sites of post-communist cities-St. Petersburg, Moscow, Berlin, and Prague-and the imagined homelands of exiles-Benjamin, Nabokov, Mandelstam, and Brodsky. From Jurassic Park to the Totalitarian Sculpture Garden, from love letters on Kafka&#39;s grave to conversations with Hitler&#39;s impersonator, Boym unravels the threads of this global epidemic of longing and its antidotes.</p><p>Svetlana Boym is a writer and Professor of Slavic and Comparative Literature at Harvard. She is the author of Common Places: Mythologies of Everyday Life in Russia and Death in Quotation Marks, as well as of short stories, plays, and a novel. She is a native of St. Petersburg, and lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.The future of nostalgia isn't what it used to be, or at least it won't be once this book starts making its way through academic circles. A sort of training manual for the wistful, Boym's book alternates "between critical reflection and storytelling, hoping to grasp the rhythm of longing, its enticements and entrapments"; along the way, the author not only gives new life to an old idea but also offers a number of original terms that can be used to describe the experience. The first part of Boym's study surveys the history of nostalgia as a disease and introduces two varieties, a "restorative nostalgia" that may contain conspiratorial elements (the notion that a certain "they" have destroyed "our" homeland, for example), and a "reflective nostalgia" that leads to a sense of not being able to go home again. Part two deals with postcommunist cities such as Moscow and St. Petersburg (where Boym, now a Harvard professor of Slavic and comparative literature, worked as a tour guide in the late '70s) and may be of more interest to pure Russophiles than to intellectuals in general. The book's third and final section examines the work of Nabokov, Brodsky and other artists whom Boym calls, in her most useful contribution to critical vocabulary, "off-modern." Neither modern nor postmodern, these artists (and their ranks include such odd ducks from the last century as Igor Stravinsky, Walter Benjamin, Julio Cort&nbsp;zar and Georges Perec) "explore side shadows and back alleys rather than the straight road of progress." Thus the past may be conceptualized in any number of ways, and apparently, at least according to the author, the only truly pernicious nostalgia is the prefabricated, Disney-fied kind that keeps one from thinking about the future. Otherwise, says Boym, the sky, whether it's the one you see overhead or the one you remember, is the limit. (Apr.) Forecast: This is an interesting addition to cultural history, but a bit esoteric, and is unlikely to find a readerhip outside of the literati.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>WHY RESEARCH MATTERS</h2><p>This concise resource provides practical applications of why research methods are important for public administrators, who do not routinely perform data analysis, but often find themselves having to evaluate and make important decisions based on data analysis and evaluative reports they receive. It is also intended as a supplemental text for research methods courses at the graduate level and upper division undergraduate level. Why Research Methods Matter is essential reading for current and future managers in the public sector who seek to become savvy consumers of research.<br><br> Advance Praise<br><br> "Why do research methods matter? Gooden and Berry-James have answered the question with a book that is readable, understandable, and motivating. Well done!" (Joseph Wholey, University of Southern California)<br><br>"Susan Gooden and RaJade Berry-James present a clear, concise primer on the art and science of research and its application and value to public service professionals. Those of us who have dealt with the 'relevance challenge' will welcome this practice-oriented book and its argument for understanding and using a scientific approach that also recognizes a role for professional expertise in decision making." (C. Michelle Piskulich, Oakland University)<br><br> "Public administration professors connect theory to practice. In so doing, we prepare students to make good decisions based on analysis of data. However, connecting these two can be an arduous task. Gooden and Berry-James have done yeoman's work in bringing to life a subject that is not intuitive for all students. The book offers an excellent and indispensable guide to research methods for first timers. I highly recommend it." (Charles E.

S. Eliot were originally commissioned for a pamphlet series of the same name that first ran between 1927 and 1931. ('Nobody else seemed to want the title afterward,' said Eliot of the series, 'so I kept it for myself.') That pamphlet series inventively paired an unpublished poem by a leading writer of the day with new artwork from an eminent artist. Thomas Hardy, Siegfried Sassoon, Barnett Freedman and John Nash were among the contributors to the first set, which broadly carried a Christmas theme and which sold for one shilling. The publisher's hope was that the pamphlets might double-up as greeting cards, and Eliot himself sent them as festive gifts to the writers on Faber's poetry list.<br><br> This handsome new publication brings together, for the first time in a single edition, the six poems that T. S. Eliot wrote for the series, and in so doing restores them to the company of the artworks that originally partnered them.<br><b> </b></p><p>Thomas Stearns Eliot was born in St Louis, Missouri in 1888. He was educated at Harvard, at the Sorbonne in Paris, and at Merton College, Oxford. He settled in England in 1915, the year in which he married Vivienne Haigh-Wood and also met his contemporary Ezra Pound for the first time. After teaching for a year or so he joined Lloyds Bank in the City of London in 1917, the year in which he published his first volume, Prufrock and Other Observations.</p><h2>Magician&#39;s Gambit (Belgariad)</h2><p>Ce'Nedra, Imperial Princess of Tolnedra, had joined a dangerous mission to recover the stolen Orb that supposedly protected the West from the evil God Torak.

According to their view, moral facts cannot be accommodated by a suitably scientific picture of the world. However, recent developments in moral theory, the philosophy of science, and the philosophy of language have undermined the standard arguments against moral realism and have led many to maintain that there are powerful reasons for believing in moral facts. As a result, moral realism is enjoying renewed vitality, while the arguments against it have of necessity become more sophisticated and penetrating.</p><p>This collection of influential essays illustrates the range, depth, and importance of moral realism, the fundamental issues it raises, and the problems it faces. Geoffrey Sayre-McCord has chosen accessible, rigorous, and thought-provoking papers, all of which are rich enough to encourage and reward several readings and careful study. In addition, the volume strikes a balance between wide-ranging papers that advance a barrage of arguments, and more focused papers that develop a few arguments in great detail. What emerges is a comprehensive overview of the moral realism debate that exhibits the scope, as well as the intricacies, of the arguments marshaled on all sides. It will be welcomed by scholars and students of philosophy, the social sciences, and political science.</p><p>CONTRIBUTORS: A. J. Ayer, Simon Blackburn, Richard Boyd, Gilbert<br>Harman, Jonathan Lear,' J. L. Mackie, John McDowell, Mark Platts,<br>Geoffrey Sayre-McCord, Nicholas Sturgeon, David Wiggins, Bernard<br>Williams.</p></p><p><p>"This volume is both important and timely. The debate about moral realism is central to moral philosophy, and it has been the focus of renewed interest in recent years, with a significant body of interesting new work on the topic beginning to emerge. Yet there is no comparable anthology in existence, and most of the new work is scattered throughout the literature, some of it in fairly inaccessible places. Thus this anthology will find an interested and receptive audience.

CLEAN PAGES.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Period</h2><p>Period - the end of the sentence, and the final statement of Cooper&#39;s five-book cycle. In it, Cooper has taken his familiar themes - strangely irresistible and interchangeable young men, passion that crosses into murder, the lure of drugs, the culpability of authorship, and the inexact, haunting communications of feeling - and melded them into a novel of flawless form and immense power. Set in a spare, smoke-and-mirror-filled world of secret websites, Goth bands, Satanism, pornography, and Outsider art, Period is at once a monument to the memory of George Miles - the object of obsession in Closer - and a literary disappearing act as mysterious as it is logical.</p><p>Dennis Cooper is the winner of the Ferro-Grumley Award for Closer, and Guide was a Los Angeles Times bestseller and one of its Ten Best Books of the Year. He lives in Los Angeles.Cooper's fans will not be surprised, but the uninitiated may balk at his new novel's macabre world of disaffected young men engaging in Satanic sacrifice, gang rape, cutting-edge pornography and nonchalant mutilation and murder. Undaunted readers will find a subversive brilliance and considerable wit behind this darkly comic ride through the looking glass of marginal youth culture. Cooper (Closer; Frisk; Try; Guide) imbues the fifth and final novel in his "Sex and Death" series with a mythic tone, centering the action in a remote, nondescript town and a mysterious house, all black on the inside except for a large mirror. Events take place on both sides of the mirror in two (or more) equally dangerous worlds that reflect and affect one another. But that is only the beginning of the mirror imagery. The main characters are a string of young men who eerily resemble each other, including voyeurs Leon and Nate, pothead Dagger, and Nate's boyfriend Bob, who's obsessed with dead-ex George. And there is a novel called Period within this novel, which a Satanic band called the Omen have popularized among their Goth followers. A cabal of pornographic Webmasters and their online audience likewise celebrate the inner novel, which also features a cast of interchangeable young men, a nondescript town and its mysterious house. As the two narratives, the characters and locations mirror each other, it eventually becomes clear that reality is only a series of endless reflections. Cooper plumbs themes of obsession, love, identity, authorial paradox and communication breakdown with virtuosic narrative technique. And he succeeds in wringing insight and even humor from abhorrent visions of sadism and blackness.

When the grandfather of Jimmy Broda, a stockboy Nick has befriended, asks him to help find the missing boy, Nick reluctantly agrees. Jimmy has been hanging out with skinheads and Nick begins plumbing that world after he's fired from his job. With time and severance pay on his hands he follows Jimmy's trail to the resorts of the Carolina Outer Banks, moving back to Washington to unravel a plot that involves drugs, violence and murder. Besides offering an inside look at electronics retailing, dreary skinheads, a nostalgic list of late baby-boomers' pop songs and quite a lot of drinking (including a solo binge by Nick that feels gratuitous), Pelacanos also delivers a blazing, climactic shoot-out. Nick's weltschmerz is saved from excess by the cool, controlled prose and the realistic, rather bleak resolution. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Time Travelers Of The Bible: How the Ancient prophets Shattered the Time Barrier</h2><p>250-Word Summary of Time Travelers of the Bible:<br> <br> Who hasn&#x2019;t thought of travelling in time?

Long before the dinosaurs were discovered and the notion of geological time acquired currency, many citizens of the new republic believed this mythical beast to be a ferocious carnivore, capable of crushing deer and elk in its "monstrous grinders." During the American Revolution, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson avidly collected its bones; for the founding fathers, its massive jaws symbolized the violence of the natural world and the emerging nation's own dreams of conquest.</p> <p>Paul Semonin's lively history of this icon of American nationalism focuses on the link between patriotism and prehistoric nature. From the first fist-sized tooth found in 1705, which Puritan clergyman claimed was evidence of human giants, to the scientific racialism associated with the discovery of extinct species, Semonin traces the evangelical beliefs, Enlightenment thought, and Indian myths which led the founding fathers to view this prehistoric monster as a symbol of nationhood.</p> <p>Semonin also sees the mystery of the mastodon in early America as a cautionary tale about the first flowering of our narcissistic fascination with a prehistoric nature ruled by ferocious carnivores. As such, <b>American Monster</b> offers fresh insights into the genesis of the ongoing fascination with dinosaurs.</p></p><p><p><b>Paul Semonin</b> is a cultural historian and graphic artist.

Coetzee&#x2019;s searing novel tells the story of David Lurie, a twice divorced, 52-year-old professor of communications and Romantic Poetry at Cape Technical University. Lurie believes he has created a comfortable, if somewhat passionless, life for himself. He lives within his financial and emotional means. Though his position at the university has been reduced, he teaches his classes dutifully; and while age has diminished his attractiveness, weekly visits to a prostitute satisfy his sexual needs. He considers himself happy. But when Lurie seduces one of his students, he sets in motion a chain of events that will shatter his complacency and leave him utterly disgraced. <p>Lurie pursues his relationship with the young Melanie<b>&#x2014;</b>whom he describes as having hips &#x201c;as slim as a twelve-year-old&#x2019;s&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;</b>obsessively and narcissistically, ignoring, on one occasion, her wish not to have sex. When Melanie and her father lodge a complaint against him, Lurie is brought before an academic committee where he admits he is guilty of all the charges but refuses to express any repentance for his acts. In the furor of the scandal, jeered at by students, threatened by Melanie&#x2019;s boyfriend, ridiculed by his ex-wife, Lurie is forced to resign and flees Cape Town for his daughter Lucy&#x2019;s smallholding in the country. There he struggles to rekindle his relationship with Lucy and to understand the changing relations of blacks and whites in the new South Africa. But when three black strangers appear at their house asking to make a phone call, a harrowing afternoon of violence follows which leaves both of them badly shaken and further estranged from one another. After a brief return to Cape Town, where Lurie discovers his home has also been vandalized, he decides to stay on with his daughter, who is pregnant with the child of one of her attackers. Now thoroughly humiliated, Lurie devotes himself to volunteering at the animal clinic, where he helps put down diseased and unwanted dogs. It is here, Coetzee seems to suggest, that Lurie gains a redeeming sense of compassion absent from his life up to this point.</p> <p>Written with the austere clarity that has made J. M. Coetzee the winner of two Booker Prizes, <b>Disgrace</b> explores the downfall of one man and dramatizes, with unforgettable, at times almost unbearable, vividness the plight of a country caught in the chaotic aftermath of centuries of racial oppression.</p> &nbsp;</p><p>David Lurie is hardly the hero of his own life, or anyone else's. At 52, the protagonist of <i>Disgrace</i> is at the end of his professional and romantic game, and seems to be deliberately courting disaster. Long a professor of modern languages at Cape Town University College, he has recently been relegated to adjunct professor of communications at the same institution, now pointedly renamed Cape Technical University: <blockquote> Although he devotes hours of each day to his new discipline, he finds its first premise, as enunciated in the Communications 101 handbook, preposterous: "Human society has created language in order that we may communicate our thoughts, feelings and intentions to each other." His own opinion, which he does not air, is that the origins of speech lie in song, and the origins of song in the need to fill out with sound the overlarge and rather empty human soul. </blockquote> Twice married and twice divorced, his magnetic looks on the wane, David rather cruelly seduces one of his students, and his conduct unbecoming is soon uncovered. In his eighth novel, J.M. Coetzee might have been content to write a searching academic satire. But in <i>Disgrace</i> he is intent on much more, and his art is as uncompromising as his main character, though infinitely more complex. Refusing to play the public-repentance game, David gets himself fired--a final gesture of contempt. Now, he thinks, he will write something on Byron's last years. Not empty, unread criticism, "prose measured by the yard," but a libretto. To do so, he heads for the Eastern Cape and his daughter's farm. In her mid-20s, Lucy has turned her back on city sophistications: with five hectares, she makes her living by growing flowers and produce and boarding dogs. "Nothing," David thinks, "could be more simple." But nothing, in fact, is more complicated--or, in the new South Africa, more dangerous. Far from being the refuge he has sought, little is safe in Salem. Just as David has settled into his temporary role as farmworker and unenthusiastic animal-shelter volunteer, he and Lucy are attacked by three black men. Unable to protect his daughter, David's disgrace is complete. Hers, however, is far worse. <p> There is much more to be explored in Coetzee's painful novel, and few consolations. It would be easy to pick up on his title and view <i>Disgrace</i> as a complicated working-out of personal and political shame and responsibility. But the author is concerned with his country's history, brutalities, and betrayals. Coetzee is also intent on what measure of soul and rights we allow animals. After the attack, David takes his role at the shelter more seriously, at last achieving an unlikely home and some measure of love. In Coetzee's recent Princeton lectures, <i>The Lives of Animals</i>, an aging novelist tells her audience that the question that occupies all lab and zoo creatures is, "Where is home, and how do I get there?" David, though still all-powerful compared to those he helps dispose of, is equally trapped, equally lost. </p><p> <i>Disgrace</i> is almost willfully plain. Yet it possesses its own lean, heartbreaking lyricism, most of all in its descriptions of unwanted animals. At the start of the novel, David tells his student that poetry either speaks instantly to the reader--"a flash of revelation and a flash of response"--or not at all. Coetzee's book speaks differently, its layers and sadnesses endlessly unfolding. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>"The richness of <b>Disgrace</b> lies in the elegant and allegorical role reversals, the spare symbolism of the language and in the characterization. We may not like David Lurie, but in Coetzee's skillful hands we can't dismiss him without pity." -- <i>The Globe and Mail</i> <br> <br>"Coetzee is able to dissect the human psyche with a surgeon's touch." -- <i>The Hamilton Spectator</i> <br> <br>"Marvellous." -- <i>The National Post</i> <br> <br>" <b>Disgrace</b> is a subtle, multilayered story, as much concerned with politics as it is with the itch of male flesh. Coetzee's prose is chaste and lyrical -- it is a relief to encounter writing as quietly stylish as this." -- <i>Independent</i> <br> <br>" <b>Disgrace</b> is at the frontier of world literature." -- <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> <br> <br>"J.M. Coetzee's vision goes to the nerve-centre of being. What he finds there is more than most people will ever know about themselves, and he conveys it with a brilliant writer's mastery of tension and elegance." -- Nadine Gordimer</p><h2>Mystery Mile</h2><p>Judge Crowdy Lobbett has found evidence pointing to the identity of the criminal mastermind behind the deadly Simister gang.

Sayers, and Ngaio Marsh. Allingham is J.K. Rowling&#39;s favourite Golden Age author and Agatha Christie said of Allingham that out of all the detective stories she remembers, Margery Allingham &#39;stands out like a shining light&#39;. She was born in Ealing, London in 1904 to a very literary family; her parents were both writers, and her aunt ran a magazine, so it was natural that Margery too would begin writing at an early age. She wrote steadily through her school days, first in Colchester and later as a boarder at the Perse School for Girls in Cambridge, where she wrote, produced, and performed in a costume play. After her return to London in 1920 she enrolled at the Regent Street Polytechnic, where she studied drama and speech training in a successful attempt to overcome a childhood stammer. There she met Phillip Youngman Carter, who would become her husband and collaborator, designing the jackets for many of her future books. The Allingham family retained a house on Mersea Island, a few miles from Layer Breton, and it was here that Margery found the material for her first novel, the adventure story Blackkerchief Dick (1923), which was published when she was just nineteen. She went on to pen multiple novels, some of which dealt with occult themes and some with mystery, as well as writing plays and stories - her first detective story, The White Cottage Mystery, was serialized in the Daily Express in 1927. Allingham died at the age of 62, and her final novel, A Cargo of Eagles, was finished by her husband at her request and published posthumously in 1968.Albert Campion takes on the usual collection of unbelievable, yet charming, characters. The eccentric cast, focusing on an American judge pursued by the ominous Simister gang, is given a range of voices by narrator Francis Matthews. Though Matthews has recorded numerous Allingham titles, the husky American accents and servants&#39; dialects are somewhat distracting. The secondary characters are slightly exaggerated while the central characters&#39; accents are restrained. The narrator does lead the reader adeptly through the twists of the tale and presents an accomplished interpretation. Another of Campion&#39;s &#34;adventures undertaken for a small fee,&#34; this will undoubtedly give satisfaction to the enthusiast. R.F.W. An AUDIOFILE Earphones Award winner (c)AudioFile, Portland, Maine</p><h2>A Plague of Angels: A Sir Robert Carey Mystery</h2><p>In 1592, dashing courtier Sir Robert Carey took up his northern post as Warden of the West March in order to escape the complications of creditors and court life. Trouble, however, dogs his heels wherever he goes. And where he goes in autumn, after the summer's misadventures in Carlisle, is back to London upon a summons from his father.<p>Carey is on difficult terms with his powerful sire, Henry, Lord Hunsdon. Hunsdon, son of Anne Boleyn's elder sister, Mary -- and probably of a young King Henry VIII -- swings a lot of weight as ""cousin"" to Queen Elizabeth. But Hunsdon needs his ingenious younger son, Carey to sort out the difficulties his elder son has got himself into as an innocent party in a plot to discredit the family.</p><p>Accompanied by the shrewd Sergeant George Dodd, who's like a fish out of water as he copes with the strange Londoners, Carey tackles Catholics, treachery, and such persons known to history and students of literature as George Greene and Christopher Marlowe who are working as spies and double agents. Most arresting is a portrait of a love-sick, snivelling hanger-on named Will Shakespeare....</p></p><p>Patricia Finney (who writes as P. F. Chisholm) has been writing since she was seven and getting paid for it since she was 15. Her first book, A Shadow of Gulls, was published when she was 18 years old, and won the David Higham Award for Best First Novel. She studied Modern History at Wadham College, Oxford. Since which time she has accumulated an American husband, one daughter, two sons, a dog and three cats, plus assorted rodents theoretically owned by her offspring. Her husband&#x2019;s work as a barrister (an English lawyer, specialising in litigation) has given her fascinating insight into real-life crime and her children have taught her more than she wanted to know about human nature. She has had a variety of jobs which have included editing a medical journal and writing a weekly column in the London Evening Standard. She presently lives in Cornwall, and is working on the next couple of Carey stories, and some screenplays. She is planning a contemporary novel as well, whenever her fulltime work as nanny, chauffeur, handywoman, administrator, accountant and legal secretary gives her a chance to write it.In this fourth mystery featuring Sir Robert Carey (after A Surfeit of Guns), strong writing and a wealth of detail about Elizabethan London cannot make up for a painfully slow plot. The book opens with Carey and his sidekick, Sergeant Dodd, on the road to London, a clever and lively scene that promises much more action than what actually follows. Carey, based on a historical figure of the same name, has been called to the city by his father, Lord Chamberlain Hunsdon, half-brother to Queen Elizabeth, to search for his missing brother Edmund. It seems Edmund, never the most sensible of men, has gotten himself mixed up in false alchemy and counterfeiting, a crime that is considered treason. As Carey and Dodd investigate the scheme that drew in Edmund, they discover that Thomas Heneage, the greedy and cruel vice chamberlain, is almost certainly involved. Facts, however, are as elusive as Edmund continues to be. Alternately helped and hindered by the playwrights Christopher Marlowe and William Shakespeare, and merely frustrated by the poet Robert Greene, Carey and Dodd dart about the streets of London, visiting bars and churches, literally avoiding the plague as well as the wiles of the lovely Mistress Bassano. Traitors and allies are finally sorted out in the Fleet, a debtor's prison in London that Chisholm (the pseudonym of historical novelist Patricia Finney) portrays in all its sordid misery.

T.J.M. � AudioFile 2008, Portland, Maine</p><h2>Through the Dark Labyrinth: A Biography of Lawrence Durrell</h2><p>Traces the life of Durrell, author of &#34;The Alexandria Quartet,&#34; and discusses the influence of Eastern religions on his work</p><p>Lawrence Durrell, best known as the author of the acclaimed <i>Alexandria Quartet</i>, is often considered to be one of the most significant writers of the 20th century. A friend and confidante of Henry Miller and Anais Nin, he was reputed to live on the edge while pursuing his career as a British diplomat. In this biography, Gordon Bowker, the author of <i>Pursued by Furies: A life of Malcom Lowry</i>, reveals Durrell to be a complex man beset at times by incredibly painful circumstances that he was somehow able to transmute into his fiction. Indeed, at times the writer's life, with four marriages, many affairs, some unusual sexual obsessions, and experiences living and traveling in unusual locations, almost reads like exotic fiction.As with his equally masterful biography of Malcolm Lowry (Pursued by Furies, 1995), Bowker here does signal service in reviving a once great literary reputation. Durrell (191290) may only occupy the second tier of 20th- century British writers, but he's at the very top of it. Like Lowry, he was personally unpleasant, abusive, misogynistic, blithely lecherous, cantankerous, an inveterate drunk. Writing tended to goad him into a state bordering on madness, drawing those around him into the fecund maelstrom, often with unpleasant results. He wrote quickly, anxiously; many of his greatest books were produced in a matter of months. Though a proponent of Freudian analysis, he stayed far away from the analyst's couch, afraid the talking cure would dissipate his creativity. While Durrell had an ostensibly large artistic range--poems, travelogues, thrillers, even paintings--most of his work returned to a few large themes, in Bowker's words: ``the quest for wholeness through sex and art and, faced with the disintegrating ego and a world gone mad, the confrontation of death and the coming to terms with it.'' Until modern mores caught up with him, his focus on sex was considered quite scandalous, and he was often lumped together as a pornographer with his close friend Henry Miller. Yet behind all the bad behavior and outrageousness, Durrell worked a good deal of his life as a respected member of the British diplomatic corps, with postings to Cyprus and Yugoslavia. Bowker is a shrewd judge of character and has substantial storytelling flair. He effortlessly weaves biography and criticism together into a discerning whole. The only major flaw in this unauthorized biography is beyond his control: The ``fair use'' doctrine drastically limits his ability to quote from Durrell's work. A noteworthy success that meets the highest standard of literary biography. (16 pages illustrations, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Hebard, a pioneer in the area of canine search-and-rescue work, recounts with co-author Whittemore over 25 years of her life spent training her dogs, herself, and others to assist in the location of lost persons, criminals, and disaster victims. A woman of conviction and purpose, Hebard was able to rise to head of the U.S. Disaster Team Canine Unit and still raise a family. Hebard describes her motivation, how she acquired her dogs, and how she trained them and provides gripping, sometimes graphic, accounts of rescues she participated in. (She located cadavers as well as live persons.) Readers will feel the terror of the 1985 Mexico City earthquake and the horror of the Oklahoma City bombing. They will grieve with Hebard and her family as her canine partners age and pass on. Readers will also be impressed by Hebard's depth of understanding of canine psychology and positive motivational training techniques. Highly recommended.?Edell Marie Schaefer, Brookfield P.L., Wis.<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Hebard neither had a conventional upbringing nor has had what could be considered an ordinary family life as an adult. Instead, the multilingual child of a diplomatic family settled down to raise her own four children, while at the same time becoming increasingly involved with training her dogs to assist in search-and-rescue missions. This account of Hebard's life will appeal to animal lovers as well as those readers who appreciate adventure travel. But unlike most travel writing, this inspirational narrative vividly presents not only the extreme conditions endured by rescue teams, but also the incredible emotional toll that comes with recovering victims, dead or alive. The heartfelt facts of Hebard's love and regard for the dogs she has raised over the years somewhat ease the somber mood emanating from multiple accounts of traumatic rescues in disaster areas shattered by earthquakes and floods. <i>Alice Joyce</i></p><h2>One Liners : A Mini-Manual for a Spiritual Life</h2><p>One-Liners is a collection of over 200 penetrating and pithy spiritual instructions from spiritual guru Ram Dass, who describes it as a &#39;distillation&#39; of the lectures he has given over the last couple of decades.

He lives in Cedar City, Utah.1 <br>&nbsp; <br> <br>In the early summer afternoon, Quaeryt paced back and forth across the narrow stone stoop outside the main entrance to the hold house at Nordruil, occasionally blotting the sweat off his forehead, and glancing up at the worn and graying limestone walls and the single square tower that was likely centuries old. The grounds had received indifferent care, and it was clear that the hold house had been cleaned quickly and received new linens just before he had arrived, along with a few rankers and others to assist the hold staff. <br> <i>Just for Vaelora and me?</i> That was only one of the things that worried Quaeryt about what Bhayar had in mind. <br>Quaeryt had been waiting for Vaelora for well over a week. He had mostly recovered from the efforts that had changed the battle over Ferravyl from what would have likely been a bloody standoff into an overwhelming victory for Lord Bhayar and Telaryn&#x2014;but at the uncounted cost of revealing to Bhayar the scope of his imaging abilities&nbsp;&#x2026; and the other cost he had not even imagined. He shook his head, not wanting to think about it, or about the icy dreams, along with the bruises and strained muscles, that had kept him from sleeping on several nights. <br>Before all that long, he&#x2019;d be recalled to duty on the forthcoming campaign into Bovaria&nbsp;&#x2026; and yet Bhayar had insisted that Quaeryt recover at one of Bhayar&#x2019;s less imposing estates and wait for the arrival of Vaelora. <br> <i>Is that to keep me away from the commanders and the imagers? Why? So he and Myskyl or Deucalon can see if they can do without me?</i> Somehow, Quaeryt had strong doubts that Bhayar&#x2019;s protestations of concern about him were the only reasons why he had been recuperating in the comparative luxury available at Nordruil, even awaiting Vaelora. Especially since he likely would only be able to spend a few days with her. <br>He paced back across the stones once again. A courier had galloped up less than a glass before, saying that his wife was some three milles away. Since then, every moment of that Mardi afternoon had felt like a quint, every quint like a glass. He&#x2019;d even asked the kitchen staff to have a light afternoon meal ready; not that he felt like eating, but she might well after the long ride. <br> <i>What is taking her so long?</i> He glanced toward the long winding drive once again, then stopped as he saw riders. He forced himself to stand still and wait while they rode up the narrow worn and graveled way. When they were more than a hundred yards away, he could see Vaelora, with Captain Eleryt riding beside her, and a full company following them. <br>Once more, he was amazed at the grace with which she rode and what a striking figure she was in the saddle. <i>But then, you&#x2019;ve always found her so.</i> <br>Their eyes held each other&#x2019;s as soon as she turned her mount around the overgrown garden that the approach drive circled, although neither spoke as she rode toward him and then reined up. <br>&#x201c;My thanks to you, Captain.&#x201d; Quaeryt inclined his head to Eleryt, then stepped down to the mounting block. <br>&#x201c;My pleasure, sir.&#x201d; <br>Quaeryt was already looking into Vaelora&#x2019;s light brown eyes, even before she dismounted and stepped into his arms. For several moments he just held her before murmuring, in Bovarian, as they did when alone, &#x201c;I missed you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I missed you, too.&#x201d; Her arms tightened about him. <br>&#x201c;I worried about you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Worried about me? When I heard you&#x2019;d been injured&#x2026;&#x201d; Vaelora eased back. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t hurt you?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t that kind of injury. I got caught in the ice storm.&#x201d; He lowered his voice. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll explain later.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d better,&#x201d; she whispered as her arms went around him again, if but for a long moment before she stepped back. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been a long ride, and I was so worried.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Would you like something to eat?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;If you wouldn&#x2019;t mind, dearest.&#x201d; Her smile was impish. &#x201c;If it doesn&#x2019;t take too long to prepare&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Those should have been my words,&#x201d; he replied with a soft laugh. <br>&#x201c;I said them for you&nbsp;&#x2026; but I am hungry.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I thought you might be. I asked the kitchen to have a light meal ready.&#x201d; Quaeryt turned to Eleryt, who remained waiting. &#x201c;I do apologize, Captain, for my preoccupation. There are refreshments for you and your men and quarters as well. Lord Bhayar has requested that you remain here until further notice. I trust that will not inconvenience you and them.&#x201d; <br>Eleryt smiled. &#x201c;Sir&nbsp;&#x2026; that is not a problem.&#x201d; <br>Quaeryt understood that, since Eleryt&#x2019;s company would have better quarters and fare. &#x201c;We will talk later.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; <br>As two of the rankers assigned to Nordruil hurried out to unload Vaelora&#x2019;s gear, Quaeryt took his wife&#x2019;s arm and led her through an ancient square arch into the hold house, guiding her toward the shaded rear terrace beside the fountains, far cooler than any chamber inside. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never been here before,&#x201d; said Vaelora, her eyes taking in the stone walls of the main corridor as they passed through the receiving hall. <br>&#x201c;Until last week, I don&#x2019;t think Bhayar had been, either,&#x201d; replied Quaeryt. The thought that Bhayar had so many properties that he&#x2019;d never even visited one as large as Nordruil&#x2014;and that Bhayar thought it small&#x2014;still amazed Quaeryt, although he understood how that could be as they walked past the matching parlors, and then the main dining hall and the grand salon, and finally into the study, with its single wall of books, and out through the double doors and onto the terrace, where a table for two awaited them. <br>&#x201c;What would you like to drink?&#x201d; asked Quaeryt after he seated her. <br>&#x201c;A pale or amber lager, please.&#x201d; Vaelora looked to the serving woman. <br>&#x201c;Two, please,&#x201d; added Quaeryt. <br>The one serving woman eased away, and another placed melon slices before each of them, graced on the side with lime wedges. The first returned with two beakers of a pale golden lager. <br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; said Quaeryt quietly. <br>Vaelora immediately took a lime wedge and squeezed it over the melon, then began to devour the melon&#x2014;if gracefully, Quaeryt noted. <br>He ate his own melon not quite so quickly, but asked as he finished, &#x201c;How was your journey?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe I ate that so quickly.&#x201d; Vaelora blotted her lips with the pale cream linen napkin. &#x201c;The ride was long and hard. I&#x2019;m a bit sore in places. I was so worried about you. Yet I had the feeling that you would be all right. Then I worried I was deceiving myself.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I worried about you&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You need to worry about yourself, dearest.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I usually don&#x2019;t have time for that, and when I do, it doesn&#x2019;t matter, and I worry about you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Keep saying things like that.&#x201d; Vaelora took a sip of the lager. &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t bad.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;For the south, you mean?&#x201d; Quaeryt grinned. <br>Vaelora returned the expression. <br>In the momentary silence he could hear the raucous call of a bird, most likely a redjay, coming from the gardens to beyond the lawn behind the terrace. <br>The first serving woman removed the melon platters, and the second replaced them with strips of chilled seasoned fowl, accompanied by sliced early peaches drizzled with thick cream. <br>Quaeryt was surprised to find that he was actually hungry, and neither of them spoke for a time. <br>&#x201c;Are you going to tell me what happened?&#x201d; asked Vaelora. After a moment she went on. &#x201c;Bhayar met me in Ferravyl. He told me about the ice storm, and how the imagers exploded the Bovarian barges.&#x201d; <br>Quaeryt couldn&#x2019;t help but frown. <br>&#x201c;Dearest&nbsp;&#x2026; he is my brother, and we spoke for less than a glass. He was very earnest in not wanting to delay my reaching you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m certain he was earnest about that.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We can talk about him later. I want to know about you.&#x201d; <br>Quaeryt glanced to the side of the terrace where the two servers stood, then back to Vaelora. <br>She nodded in understanding. &#x201c;Just what happened, although they may not speak Bovarian that well.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The ice came down in sheets. Most of it covered the Bovarians. Bhayar said that we lost almost a battalion. They lost close to eight regiments. It was truly awful.&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;Yet&nbsp;&#x2026; we were so evenly matched that&nbsp;&#x2026; without the storm&nbsp;&#x2026; we both might have lost even more.&#x201d; He shook his head. <br>&#x201c;What about you? When I heard&nbsp;&#x2026; That was why I rode from first light into the night every day.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I was caught close to the ice. They told me I didn&#x2019;t wake for three days, and they weren&#x2019;t sure I would. They piled quilts over me&#x2026;&#x201d; He shook his head wryly. &#x201c;I finally woke up sweating.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You did too much.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Anything less wouldn&#x2019;t have worked.&#x201d; His eyes again flicked toward the serving women. <br>&#x201c;You can tell me more&nbsp;&#x2026; later.&#x201d; Vaelora took a last swallow from her beaker. As she set it down, her eyes met his again. <br>Quaeryt blushed. <br>&#x201c;Would you mind&nbsp;&#x2026; dearest&nbsp;&#x2026; if I bathed?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Of course not.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You could&nbsp;&#x2026; keep me company&#x2026;&#x201d; Her smile and eyes were more than inviting as she glanced to the upper levels of the hold house and then back to Quaeryt. <br>As he rose and guided her from her chair, Quaeryt doubted he would recall what he ate. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Later&#x2014;much later, in the orangish glow of twilight&#x2014;Vaelora sat up in the ancient goldenwood bed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re looking at me as if you&#x2019;ve never seen me this way before.&#x201d; <br> <i>I haven&#x2019;t&nbsp;&#x2026; not exactly like this&nbsp;&#x2026; not understanding what I might have lost.</i> &#x201c;I told you. I missed you. There were times when I didn&#x2019;t know if I&#x2019;d see you again.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You got my letters?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I got the note you left in my saddlebag, and the one you wrote about the warm rain&nbsp;&#x2026; that was what made it all possible. I don&#x2019;t know that I would have thought it out without your letter.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad. I think you would have, but I wanted to make sure&nbsp;&#x2026; or try to.&#x201d; After a moment she went on. &#x201c;I told you that Bhayar did not wish to delay my reaching you. After seeing your bruises and&nbsp;&#x2026; everything&nbsp;&#x2026; I can see why.&#x201d; She reached out and let her fingers run down the side of his face, along his jawline, before leaning forward and kissing him. Then she straightened, slightly disentangling herself from his arms. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going anywhere. Nor are you. Not in the next few days, anyway.&#x201d; <br>Quaeryt couldn&#x2019;t help but frown. &#x201c;He told you that?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He told me more than that. He was proud of what you did. He won&#x2019;t tell you.&#x201d; She paused. &#x201c;How did you do it?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I told you&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Dearest&nbsp;&#x2026; it had to be more than warm rain, did it not?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It was mostly warm rain&#x2026;&#x201d; He paused, yet&nbsp;&#x2026; who else could he tell? &#x201c;Imaging takes heat&nbsp;&#x2026; or something like it. Everyone thinks that the rain froze the Bovarians.&#x201d; He shook his head slowly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not certain, but I think the imaging froze them first, and the ice rain coated them afterward.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The imaging&nbsp;&#x2026; it sucked the warmth out of them?&#x201d; <br>He nodded. &#x201c;I fear so.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Have you told Bhayar?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve told no one but you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Good. Never tell anyone else.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I dare not tell Bhayar. Not the way he is playing us both.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Of course he is. What else would you expect? You&#x2019;ve proved to be a great weapon, and you love me, and I love you. He&#x2019;ll use both of us to become the ruler of all Lydar&nbsp;&#x2026; or destroy us all in trying.&#x201d; <br>Quaeryt was still astounded at the matter-of-fact way in which she regarded her brother and how she could balance sisterly affection with cold calculation in assessing Bhayar. <i>Then again, it could just be that women are better at that than men.</i> Quaeryt didn&#x2019;t know. He only knew that Vaelora was adept at seeing the undercurrents between people, but he&#x2019;d never really known another woman, except in a casual sense, and he&#x2019;d never talked as honestly to anyone as he did to her. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see destroying him, first or later, as a good idea, either.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, someone has to unite Lydar, and we&#x2019;ll all be better off under him&nbsp;&#x2026; especially with you at his side.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not exactly a foregone conclusion,&#x201d; Quaeryt pointed out. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s anything but,&#x201d; Vaelora replied, &#x201c;except the alternatives would be less happy for both of us.&#x201d; <br>Quaeryt nodded slowly. History indicated that the relatives of unsuccessful conquerors seldom survived, and an imager who served such a ruler certainly wouldn&#x2019;t&#x2014;unless they fled in obscurity, and that wasn&#x2019;t a path Quaeryt wanted to take&nbsp;&#x2026; and doubted Vaelora did, either. <br>He laughed, not quite bitterly. &#x201c;That appears to be settled.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s another complication, dearest.&#x201d; Vaelora smiled. <br>&#x201c;Complication?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s early&nbsp;&#x2026; but women in our family know almost immediately.&#x201d; <br> <i>Women in your family?</i> Quaeryt swallowed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>She nodded. &#x201c;I feel that she&#x2019;ll be a girl.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Does Bhayar know?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No. And he won&#x2019;t, not until long after you and he leave Ferravyl.&#x201d; <br>Quaeryt didn&#x2019;t know what to say. <br>&#x201c;I&nbsp;&#x2026; decided&nbsp;&#x2026; on those last days in Tresrives. I knew you&#x2019;d be safe. But&nbsp;&#x2026; I still couldn&#x2019;t let you go&nbsp;&#x2026; not without&nbsp;&#x2026; I just couldn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; Her eyes were bright. <br>Quaeryt leaned forward and folded his arms around her. &#x201c;I love you. I love you both&#x2026;&#x201d; He could feel his own eyes tearing up. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by L. E.

She is an avid reader of detective stories.A refreshingly working-class heroine, a devoted wife and mother of three, plays reluctant sleuth in this winning cozy from British author Purser (Pastures New), set in the quaint village of Long Farnden. When the village spinster, who lives in a thatched cottage reminiscent of a tea cozy, is strangled to death, the police are eager to seek information about the victim's neighbors and friends. Who better to aid their investigation than Lois Meade, who as a house cleaner has ample access to what goes on behind her clients' closed doors? Priding herself on her professional demeanor, Lois hesitates when asked by PC Keith Simpson if she'll help, but curiosity and her recent need for personal fulfillment cause her to accept. In her quest for the killer, Lois ultimately uncovers some surprising secrets of some of Long Farnden's most prominent citizens, shaking the foundations of this seemingly peaceful village, including those of her own house. Traditional and modern combine smoothly. The village men all own Barbour coats, while the vicar inhabits a poorly heated contemporary house overlooking the town's sewage dump. A strong plot and believable characters, especially the honest, down-to-earth Lois, are certain to appeal to a wide range of readers.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Classic Horror Stories</h2><p>Stories by Lovecraft, Poe, Stoker, James, Blackwood, Machen and more.

This book is the first to tell Swan&#x2019;s story, from his days as a world-famous dancer and artist, through his film career&#x2014;which ran from silent pictures, including De Mille&#x2019;s <i>Ten Commandments</i> (1923), to Warhol&#x2019;s <i>Camp, Paul Swan, and Paul Swan I-IV</i> (1965)&#x2014;to his portrait painting late in life when Nelson Rockefeller&#x2019;s children, Malachy McCourt, and Pope Paul VI were among his subjects.</p><p>With unprecedented access to Swan&#x2019;s scrapbooks, letters, diaries, and an unpublished memoir that tells the story of a bisexual man trying to build a public life in perilous times, Janis and Richard Londraville reconstruct the intriguing life of this uniquely interesting figure, whose story, although widely glossed in the press, was until now never fully known.</p></p><p>Janis Londraville is a fellow at the Center for Independent Scholars, Associated Colleges of the St. Lawrence Valley, and holds a guest appointment on the English faculty at the State University of New York at Potsdam.

In MAVERICK, Semler will tell you how he changed his company and how you can change yours...if you dare! The extraordinary true story of 34-year-old CEO Ricardo Semler and of the rebirth of his family owned Brazilian manufacturing company, Semco. MAVERICK is a chronicle of corporate change--a change so vast and successful that Semco has been visited by over 400 corporate representatives from around the world who want to see it in action. In 1980, 21-year-old Ricardo Semler took over the reins of the company his father founded and built. Ricardo proceeded to break every rule of doing business, firing an entire echelon of upper level managers. Once he opened the floodgates to change, Semler never--even when he was tempted to--closed them again. Semler&#39;s management system allows employees to work at home, study and discuss the company&#39;s financial statements, make corporate decisions, take over the cafeteria kitchen, start their own business with company assets, and redesign the products Semco builds and how they are built. The result: in 10 years of constant experimentation--a time period in which Brazil&#39;s economy faltered--Semco has achieved a growth rate of 600%! In chronicling Semco&#39;s inner revolution, Semler shows how his radical ideas and strategies, as well as his nuts and bolts specifics, can be applied to any company anywhere.</p><p>Ricardo Semler is the CEO of Semco S.A.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Portugese</p><h2>Cadian Honour (2) (Warhammer 40,000)</h2><p>Sent to the capital world of Potence, Sergeant Minka Lesk and the Cadian 101st discover that though Cadia may have fallen, their duty continues.<br><br>For ten thousand years, Cadia stood as a bastion against the daemonic tide spewing forth from the Eye of Terror.

Sent to the capital world of Potence, Lesk and the Cadian 101st company soon discover that a rot runs through the very heart of the seemingly peaceful world.

But then come secret orders to experiment with several types of "infernal engines of war," which might delay or postpone the dreaded cross-Channel invasion by Napoleon Bonaparte, his huge army, and his thousands of invasion craft. For the rest of 1804, Alan Lewrie and his crew of the Reliant frigate will deal with things more dangerous to them than they may prove to be to the French! </p></p><p>DEWEY LAMBDIN is the author of sixteen previous Alan Lewrie novels.

Westcott pointed out. &#x201c;Else, it would have been a massacre. Another, really.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;If they don&#x2019;t come out and surrender to us, soon, it&#x2019;ll be all &#x2018;Frogs Legs <i>Flamb�,</i>&#x2019; and Dessalines&#x2019; truce be-damned,&#x201d; Captain Lewrie said with a mirthless laugh as he extended his telescope to its full length for another peek into the harbour of Cap Fran�ois&nbsp;... and at the ships anchored inside, on which the French now huddled, driven from the last fingernail grasp of their West Indies colony.<br>Evidently, the Black victors of the long, savage insurrection were getting anxious over when the French would depart, too, for those solid stone forts which had guarded the port from sea assault showed thin skeins of smoke, rising not from cook-fires but from forges where iron shot could be heated red-hot, amber-hot, to set afire those ships and all the beaten French survivors aboard them&#x2014;soldiers, civilians, sailors, women, and children. <i>Root and branch, damn their eyes,</i> Lewrie thought; <i>burn &#x2019;em all, root and branch!</i><br>He lowered his glass and grimaced as he turned to face his First Officer, Lt. Geoffrey Westcott. &#x201c;Is it askin&#x2019; too much, d&#x2019;ye imagine, sir, that the Frogs could face facts? Which is the greater failure or shame&nbsp;... admittin&#x2019; the rebel slaves beat &#x2019;em like a rug, and surrenderin&#x2019; t&#x2019;them&nbsp;... or strikin&#x2019; to a civilised foe, like us? They&#x2019;ve <i>done</i> the first, so&nbsp;... what matters the second?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Perhaps it&#x2019;s the matter of Commodore Loring&#x2019;s terms, sir,&#x201d; Lt. Westcott supplied, inclining his head towards their senior officer&#x2019;s flagship, idling under reduced sail further out to seaward. &#x201c;He will not let them dis-arm and sail for France on their parole.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Be a fool if he did,&#x201d; Lewrie said with a dismissive snort, &#x201c;and Admiralty&#x2019;d never forgive him for it if he did. We&#x2019;d, escort them to Jamaica, intern their civilians&nbsp;... make the women and kiddies comfortable&nbsp;... Rochambeau and all his officers&#x2019;d be offered parole, quarters, and funds &#x2019;til they&#x2019;re exchanged....&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course, we&#x2019;d sling all their sailors and soldiers into the prisoner hulks,&#x201d; Lt. Westcott added with a touch of whimsy, then, in a tongue-in-cheek manner, said, &#x201c;And surely some of those French <i>jeunes filles,</i> or fetching young widows&nbsp;... surely some of them <i>are,</i> sir&nbsp;... might find themselves in need of a British officer&#x2019;s &#x2018;protection&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Hmm, well...,&#x201d; Capt. Lewrie allowed, rocking on the balls of his feet, making his Hessian boots creak; they were new from a cobbler at Kingston, still in need of breaking in. &#x201c;I expect <i>you&#x2019;d</i> be one to make such an offer, Mister Westcott? I warrant you&#x2019;re a <i>generous</i> soul,&#x201d; he said with a leer. Since their first acquaintance fitting-out their new frigate at the renewal of the war with France a little after Easter, Lewrie had discovered that Geoffrey Westcott was a Buck-of-The-First-Head when it came to putting the leg over biddable young ladies&nbsp;... almost himself to the Tee, in his younger, frivolous days.<br>&#x201c;Well&nbsp;... I <i>hope</i> to be, sir,&#x201d; Lt. Westcott replied, shrugging in false modesty, or piety (it was hard to tell which), and flashing a brief, teeth-baring grin before turning sober and &#x201c;salty&#x201d; once more.<br>&#x201c;Wish ye joy of it,&#x201d; Lewrie said, turning to probe the harbour with his telescope once more.<br>Cap Fran�ois, casually known as &#x201c;Le Cap&#x201d; in better days, had at one time been the richest <i>entrep�t</i> on the French colony of Saint Domingue, rivalling Jacmel, Mole St. Nicholas, or Port-Au-Prince itself. Nigh a thousand ships had put in there each year with all the luxuries of Europe and the Orient, and had cleared laden deep with sugar, rice, molasses, and rum, making Saint Domingue the richest prize of all the Sugar Islands, richer than all the British possessions put together.<br>Cap Fran�ois and Mole St. Nicholas further west out towards the extreme Nor&#x2019;western cape of Saint Domingue were well placed for trade&#x2014;on the North side of the colony, accessible to the passages out into the broad Atlantic, which made for shorter voyages to American or European markets.<br><i>Give the Frogs</i> <i>a</i> little <i>credit,</i> Lewrie thought; <i>at least</i> they <i>made something of their half of Hispaniola.</i><br>The eastern half of Hispaniola was held by the Spanish, but San Domingo had never produced a pittance of wealth compared to the French half; cattle herding, sheep and pigs, subsistence farming&nbsp;... along with the <i>boucaniers</i> who dressed in hides, and had become the dreaded <i>buccaneers</i> of pirate lore.<br>Now, though&nbsp;... it was all lost, to both France and any other nation which might try to possess it; as Great Britain had in those early days of the French Revolution, when they&#x2019;d landed an army ashore, and had been fought back to the beaches and piers by the rebel slaves&nbsp;... when they weren&#x2019;t fighting their former <i>grands blancs</i> masters, or the <i>petits blancs</i> and half-bloods, or each other, for dominance.<br>That brute General Dessalines had once been an aide to the former house slave Toussaint L&#x2019;Ouverture, who&#x2019;d turned out to be a much more brilliant general than any that the French had sent to fight and die here. Over thirty generals, Lewrie had heard tell, and over fourty thousand French soldiers had perished, including Napoleon&#x2019;s brother-in-law, General LeClerc. Oh, LeClerc had managed to lure L&#x2019;Ouverture to a parley and had enchained him, then shipped him to die in an alpine prison in France&#x2014;dead of cold, hunger, and heart-break that Napoleon Bonaparte would betray him, the &#x201c;Napoleon of The West,&#x201d; and break all the promises of the French Revolution, of <i>Libert�, Fraternit�,</i> and <i>Egalit�,</i> of the heady vows of abolishing slavery anywhere in every French colony, in hopes that without L&#x2019;Ouverture, the rebellion would end.<br>It wasn&#x2019;t even Saint Domingue anymore, either. Now, the rebel slaves had begun to call it Haiti, or Hayti, which&#x2014;so far as Lewrie could tell from the many battles-to-the-death, the ambushes of whole battalions at a whack, the massacres of masters, mistresses, and overseers, and pretty-much anyone else of the former ruling castes, and the betrayals that had taken place here&#x2014;translated from Creole <i>patois</i> as &#x201c;Hell On Earth.&#x201d;<br>The last desperate refuges for the surviving French of Saint Domingue were the ships in harbour, anchored as far out as they could from the shore guns, but still be in the port proper; to venture out further would put them at risk of being raided and boarded at night by the blockading British squadron.<br>&#x201c;One&#x2019;d hope that Rochambeau had wits enough t&#x2019;spike his coast artillery, before he abandoned the forts, Mister Westcott,&#x201d; Captain Lewrie said to his waiting First Lieutenant.<br>&#x201c;Well&nbsp;... he <i>is</i> French, sir, so there&#x2019;s no telling.&#x201d;<br>Their frigate, HMS <i>Reliant</i>, along with the rest of the squadron that had sailed from Portsmouth in May on an independent mission, lay three miles to seaward of the coast, right at the edge of what had come to be accepted as the limits of a nation&#x2019;s, or island&#x2019;s, sovereignty, the Three Mile Limit. Three miles because that was the Range-To-Random Shot of the largest fortress gun then in use, the 42-pounder. <i>Had</i> the French ever had 42-pounders emplaced on Saint Domingue? Lewrie didn&#x2019;t know, but, just to err on the side of caution, that was how far out Commodore Loring had decided they would come to anchor.<br>&#x201c;He couldn&#x2019;t be <i>that</i> huge a fool as t&#x2019;leave &#x2019;em in place, then anchor right under &#x2019;em,&#x201d; Lewrie commented.<br>&#x201c;As I said, sir&nbsp;... he is French, after all,&#x201d; Westcott said.<br>&#x201c;Most-like, the rebels have only field guns&nbsp;... regimental guns of six-, eight-, or twelve-pound shot,&#x201d; Lewrie speculated.<br>&#x201c;Twelve-pounders firing heated shot would more than suffice, at that range from the shore to the anchored French, sir,&#x201d; Lt. Westcott opined as he briefly doffed his hat to swab his forehead with a faded handkerchief; almost the last day of November in the Year of Our Lord 1803 or not, it was a bright, sunny, and almost windless day.<br>&#x201c;Mmm-hmm,&#x201d; Lewrie agreed, intent again on the ships yonder.<br>There appeared to be at least two large <i>Compagnie des Indies</i> three-masted ships, as big as East Indiamen, perhaps another brace of similarly-sized French National ships of the line that seemed to be crammed from bilges to poop decks with humanity.<br><i>En flute,</i> or completely dis-armed, Lewrie judged them. <i>Else, they&#x2019;d be</i> completely <i>elbows t&#x2019;arseholes if they&#x2019;re still armed, and of a mind t&#x2019;resist us,</i> he told himself with a wry grin. <i>With no place t&#x2019;put the women and children if they tried.</i><br>There were a couple of frigates, one of them a very handsome and big one of at least 38 guns or better. There were some lighter, smaller two-masted brigs, even some locally-built schooners. Did the French see the sense of it and strike to Loring&#x2019;s squadron, there&#x2019;d be a nice pot of prize-money due&nbsp;... even if it had to be shared by every British warship then &#x201c;in sight&#x201d; at the moment of their striking their colours.<br><i>Don&#x2019;t half mind the</i> French <i>perishin&#x2019; in flames, but&nbsp;... we all could use some &#x201c;tin,&#x201d;</i> Lewrie thought; <i>be a shame t&#x2019;lose those ships.</i><br>Beyond the ships, ashore&nbsp;... Lewrie had seen Cap Fran�ois back in 1783, at the tail-end of the American Revolution when he had had his brief, acting-command of the <i>Shrike</i> brig for a few weeks. It had looked prosperous then. He had trailed his colours before it in the 1790s in HMS <i>Proteus,</i> his first frigate, during his first Post-Captaincy, when the slave rebellion had burst aflame, and Cap Fran�ois had even then seemed safe, secure, and ordered, as if the French had kept the uprising and slaughter at bay, deep inland, and well away from the port.<br>Now&nbsp;... it was dowdy, charred, and filthy, the looted mansions and goods warehouses broken and gaping, and the harbourside streets and piers teeming with taunting, jeering ex-slaves. What possessions the French had abandoned in their haste to flee made a colourful sea of silks and satins being haggled or fought over by the victors, and draped the native women. There was street dancing, some very faint snatches of music, making Lewrie think that he was watching some feral Carnivale. And, when the gentle sea-breeze faltered, he could almost make out the dread, rhythmic thud of <i>voudoun</i> drumming, the sort that had made him prickle with fear his one night ashore long ago at Port-Au-Prince, the drumming that had presaged the evacuation of the British Army to cut their losses to battle, poisonings, small-party ambushes, and the ever-present Malaria and Yellow Jack.<br>If there were any French left ashore for lack of room aboard the anchored ships, then God help them; they&#x2019;d have been hunted down, torn from even the deepest hidings, then butchered, raped, and tortured, or burned alive or beheaded&#x2014;perhaps guillotined in proper French fashion?&#x2014;as the last to atone for centuries of slavery and all of the cruelties that came with it.<br>Or, he imagined, for the vindictive, victorious <i>fun</i> of it!<br>One more day, and, upon the 30th of November, the French would sail and surrender, or burn in Hell, and Haiti (or Hayti) would become an independent Black republic, the only one of its kind in the world, born in a decade or more of blood-rain monsoons.<br>&#x201c;Signal from the flag!&#x201d; Midshipman Entwhistle piped up from the taffrails aft of Lewrie and the First Lieutenant. &#x201c;Our number, sir&nbsp;... &#x2018;Captain Repair On Board,&#x2019; sir!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What the Devil?&#x201d; Lewrie wondered aloud.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pass word for your Cox&#x2019;n and boat crew, sir,&#x201d; Lt. Westcott said in a crisper tone, with a doff of his hat.<br>&#x201c;Aye, but&nbsp;... whatever <i>for</i>?&#x201d; Lewrie muttered to himself.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2010 by Dewey Lambdin</p><h2>Ireland : A Novel</h2><p>One evening in 1951, an itinerant storyteller arrives unannounced and mysterious at a house in the Irish countryside. By the November fireside he begins to tell the story of this extraordinary land. One of his listeners, a nine-year-old boy, grows so entranced by the storytelling that, when the old man leaves, he devotes his life to finding him again. It is a search that uncovers both passions and mysteries, in his own life as well as the old man&#39;s, and their solving become the thrilling climax to this tale. But the life of this boy is more than just his story: it is also the telling of a people, the narrative of a nation, the history of Ireland in all its drama, intrigue and heroism. &#39;Ireland&#39; travels through the centuries by way of story after story, from the savage grip of the Ice Age to the green and troubled land of tourist brochures and news headlines. Along the way, we meet foolish kings and innocent monks, god-heroes and great works of art, shrewd Norman raiders and envoys from Rome, leaders, poets and lovers. Each illuminates the magic of Ireland, the power of England and the eternal connection to the land.</p><p>A BBC presenter for over 5 years, Delaney is considered 'one of the best loved broadcasters in Britain' (Times). Born in Ireland but now New York-based, he wrote James Joyce's Odyssey, a Top 5 non-fiction bestseller in Britain, as were The Celts &amp; Betjeman CountryWhen a storyteller comes to visit young Ronan's house, he becomes fascinated with the wanderer's art. His mother is less fascinated, throwing the man out and spawning a search for the man and Ronan's lifelong fascination with storytelling and Irish history. The stories form the backbone of the novel as Ronan traces the man's tales and tries a few of his own.

Instead, we have enlisted hundreds of millions of people into a war we can't win."&nbsp;</b><br>&nbsp;<br>What&#x2019;s the secret to losing weight? If you&#x2019;re like most of us, you&#x2019;ve tried cutting calories, sipping weird smoothies, avoiding fats, and swapping out sugar for Splenda. The real secret is that all of those things are likely to make you weigh <i>more </i>in a few years, not less. <br>&nbsp;<br>In fact, a good predictor of who will gain weight is who says they plan to lose some. Last year, 108 million Americans went on diets, to the applause of doctors, family, and friends. But long-term studies of dieters consistently find that they&#x2019;re more likely to end up gaining weight in the next two to fifteen years than people who don&#x2019;t diet. <br><br>Neuroscientist Sandra Aamodt spent three decades in her own punishing cycle of starving and regaining before turning her scientific eye to the research on weight and health. What she found defies the conventional wisdom about dieting: <br>&nbsp;<br>�Telling children that they&#x2019;re overweight makes them <i>more </i>likely to gain weight over the next few years. Weight shaming has the same effect on adults. <br>�The calories you absorb from a slice of pizza depend on your genes and on your gut bac�teria. So does the number of calories you&#x2019;re burning right now. <br>�Most people who lose a lot of weight suffer from obsessive thoughts, binge eating, depres�sion, and anxiety. They also burn less energy and find eating much more rewarding than it was before they lost weight. <br>�Fighting against your body&#x2019;s set point&#x2014;a cen�tral tenet of most diet plans&#x2014;is exhausting, psychologically damaging, and ultimately counterproductive.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>If dieting makes us fat, what should we do instead to stay healthy and reduce the risks of diabetes, heart disease, and other obesity-related conditions? With clarity and candor, Aamodt makes a spirited case for abandoning diets in favor of behav�iors that will truly improve and extend our lives.</p></p><p><p><b>SANDRA AAMODT, PH.D., </b>coauthored <i>Welcome to Your Brain </i>and <i>Welcome to Your Child&#x2019;s Brain</i>.

Where did you find the girls? What was it like in prison? She walked the walk, and now she talks the talk including &#x201c;naming names&#x201d; of her A-List celebrity clientele which include Ben Affleck, Bruce Willis, Tommy La Sorda, and government officials which are all supported by actual court documents taken from the infamous &#x201c;Black Book&#x201d; used to convict her and kept under seal during her high profile trial. What&#x2019;s most interesting is that this unlikely madam was born into wealth and privilege from an entertainment family whose mother discovered Tom Cruise! And she was an aspiring recording artist being groomed for &#x2018;pop-stardom&#x2019; during her early beginnings and pre-infamy as the Hollywood Super Madam she was known only as Babydol to the public. All she really wanted to do was make videos for MTV! For the thirteen years Ms.Gibson had her escort empire with over 1000 clients and 300 of the most beautiful women in the world, she led a 007 secret &#x2018;double-life&#x2019; as Babydol the recording artist by day, and Sasha the Super Madam by night, and keeping these two lives completely separate was paramount to her so as not to undermine her creative talents. You can still access her CD&#x2019;s on E-Bay keyword Babydol, or listen at www.babydol.com. Most compelling is the very heavy price she paid when after a seven year sting by the Organized Crime Task Force her empire crumbled leading to her capture and conviction. The political agenda surrounding her trial with celebrities and government officials found her sentenced and placed in the most severe state prison in the state of California which she covers in a most gut wrenching way detailed in this book. As she tells it :&#x201d;They couldn&#x2019;t have chosen a more poorly suited candidate for this journey; my English was too formal, I was heterosexual, didn&#x2019;t do drugs, and had no idea of how to handle the perilous hell I was subjected to. There&#x2019;s no manual you can find printed that prepares one for this hellacious journey into complete darkness.&#x201d; Further, Ms. Gibson approaches this controversial subject matter in a way that&#x2019;s gritty, nasty, salacious, sexy, frightening, horrifying, dangerous, deadly, and above all, deliciously decadent. Honestly portrayed as she speaks from the heart Secrets of a Hollywood Super Madam is a true testament of her ability to survive.

By the time he died in 1921, the name Cannon was "synonymous with the word towel" and the "model mill town" he had started to build had begun growing into the beautiful city is it is today.<br><br>In this collection of writings first published in the Charlotte Observer's "A Look Back" column, author Helen Arthur-Cornett not only informs readers about the history of Kannapolis, but also brings the past to life through comic snippets and intimate scenes from the city's earlier years. She tells about teaching practices in the first Kannapolis schools, the fierce, lasting football rivalry between Cannon and Concord High Schools, and even "Granddaddy W.D's" adventures with a runaway Model T. Trim, the beloved black mule whose unprecedented strength and endurance contributed monumentally to constructing the city in 1906 trots through the pages, accompanied by a long line of interesting characters that also made their marks on national and regional history. Whether they discuss the area's first settlers or legendary July 4th parades, the columns twinkle with charm and wit that will make this unique glimpse into the Kannapolis of yore treasured far into the future.</p><p></p><h2>Lonesome Road: A Miss Silver Mystery</h2><p>There were times when Rachel Treherne fervently wished that her beloved father had left his fortune to somebody else, so overburdened did she feel with the administration of her estate. And never more so than now for, although she was surrounded by relatives who depended on her, whom she loved and who must surely love her, there was no doubt in her mind that somebody was trying to kill her. Threatening letters could be ignored, odd tasting chocolates can be rejected, but when snakes are left in her bed, Rachel is convinced that someone means her terrible harm. Her only chance of a future life lay with Miss Silver, and Miss Silver was well on the way to unmasking the murderer when they struck again.</p><p><b>Patricia Wentworth </b>(1878&#x2013;1961) was one of the masters of classic English mystery writing. Born in India as Dora Amy Elles, she began writing after the death of her first husband, publishing her first novel in 1910. In the 1920s, she introduced the character who would make her famous: Miss Maud Silver, the former governess whose stout figure, fondness for Tennyson, and passion for knitting served to disguise a keen intellect. Along with Agatha Christie&#x2019;s Miss Marple, Miss Silver is the definitive embodiment of the English style of cozy mysteries.Fans of cozy mysteries, rejoice! Another Patricia Wentworth title is available in audio. When Rachel Treherne begins to suspect that one of her grasping relatives has designs on her life, she prevails upon shrewd Miss Silver to visit her country home. Diana Bishop portrays the kind but no-nonsense manner of the governess turned private detective. Bishop adopts a slightly softer tone when Miss Silver chooses (like Miss Marple) to act the part of an ineffectual old lady. Other female characters are also amusingly depicted, including Rachel&#39;s peevish &#34;invalid&#34; sister, her malicious niece, and her passionately protective servant. A couple of suspenseful passages and a few chilling moments round out the story. A.E.B. � AudioFile 2010, Portland, Maine</p><h2>Domain (Rats)</h2><p>The long-dreaded nuclear conflict.

These are the very same behaviours that typify good soldiering and foster a sense of belonging among troops, whether they&#x2019;re fighting on the front lines or engaged in non-combat activities away from the action. Drawing from the fields of history, psychology and anthropology, bestselling author Sebastian Junger shows us the degree to which the structure of modern society is at odds with our tribal instincts, arguing that the difficulties many veterans face upon returning home from war stem not just from the trauma they&#x2019;ve suffered, but also from the individualist nature of the societies they must reintegrate into.</p><p>A 2011 study by the Canadian Forces and Statistics Canada revealed that 78 per cent of military suicides between 1972 and 2006 involved veterans. Though these numbers are an implicit call to action, the government is just now taking steps to address the problems veterans face when they return home. But can the government ever truly eliminate the challenges faced by returning veterans? Or is the problem deeper, woven into the very fabric of our modern existence? Perhaps our circumstances are not so bleak, and simply understanding that&#x2014;beneath our modern guises&#x2014;we all belong to one tribe or another would help us face the problems not just of our nation but of our individual lives as well.</p><p>Widely researched and compellingly written, this timely look at how veterans react to coming home will change the conversation about veterans&#x2019; affairs and help us to repair our current social dynamic.</p></p><p><p><strong>Regaining our tribal connections may be the key to our psychological survival</strong></p><p>Tribal society has been exerting an almost gravitational pull on Westerners for hundreds of years, and the reason lies deep in our evolutionary past as a communal species. The most recent example of that attraction is combat veterans who come home to find themselves missing the incredibly intimate bonds of platoon life. The loss of closeness that comes at the end of deployment may explain the high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder suffered by military veterans today. Sebastian Junger argues that the difficulties many veterans face upon returning home from war do not stem entirely from the trauma they&#x2019;ve suffered, but also from the individualist societies they must reintegrate into.</p><p>Drawing from history, psychology, and anthropology, <em>Tribe</em> illustrates the irony that&#x2014;for many veterans as well as civilians&#x2014;war feels better than peace, adversity can turn out to be a blessing, and disasters are sometimes remembered more fondly than weddings or tropical vacations. Junger explains why we are stronger when we come together, and how that can be achieved even in today&#x2019;s divided world.</p><p>Sebastian Junger is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>The Perfect Storm</em>, <em>A Death in Belmont</em> and <em>Fire</em>.

A classic war autobiography, The Railway Man is a powerful tale of survival and of the human capacity to understand even those who have done us unthinkable harm.</strong></p> From <em>The Railway Man</em>:<br><br> The passion for trains and railroads is, I have been told, incurable. I have also learned that there is no cure for torture. These two afflictions have been intimately linked in the course of my life, and yet through some chance combination of luck and grace I have survived them both.<br><br> I was born in Edinburgh, in the lowlands of Scotland, in 1919. My father was an official in the General Post Office there, a career which he had started as a boy of 16 and which he intended me to imitate to the letter. He was fascinated by telephony and telegraphy, and I grew up in a world in which tinkering and inventing and making were honoured past-times. I vividly remember the first time that my father placed a giant set of headphones around my ears and I heard, through the hiss and buzz of far-off-energies, a disembodied human voice.<br><br> In the worst times, much later, when I thought I was about to die in pain and shock at the hands of men who could not imagine anything of my life, who had no respect for who I was or my history, I might have wished that my father had had a different passion. But in the 1920s, technology was still powerful and beautiful without being menacing. Who would have thought that a radio, for example, could cause terrible harm? It seemed to be a wonderful instrument by which people could speak to each other; and yet I heard Hitler ranting over airwaves, and saw two men beaten to death for their part in making such an instrument, and suffered for my own part in it for a half a century.</p><p>Eric Lomax, a British army soldier, was captured by the Japanese during the Singapore campaign of 1942. A railroad buff since a child, he took strange pleasure in his work as a POW on the Burma-Siam Railroad, which was later the subject of the film Bridge Over the River Kwai. When his captors discovered his detailed drawings of the railway, he was suspected as a spy and tortured for years. Fifty years later he discovered that the interpreter during his tortures was still alive. The two arranged a meeting and Lomax forgave him. Here is the exciting, moving and truthful account.Winner of the 1996 NCR Book Award <br>A naive young man, a radio enthusiast and radio buff, was caught up in the fall of the British Empire at Singapore in 1942. He was put to work on the Railway of Death -- the Japanese line from Thailand and Burma. The most disastrous engineering project in history, it killed 250,000 Allied prisoners and Thai labourers. Lomax helped to build a radio so that he and his comrades could follow news of the war. The radio was discovered and he was brutally tortured. One of his tormentors was a young Japanese interpreter; Lomax never forgot him. Despite an outwardly successful life, Lomax was emotionally ruined by his experiences and could never share them with anyone. Almost fifty years after the war, his life was changed by the discovery that his interrogator, the Japanese interpreter, was still alive. This is the story of a tragic life and a transformed old age.</p><h2>The Spirit Level: Poems</h2><p><br>In this collection, as ever with Heaney, personal memory and humble domestic objects -- a whitewash brush, a sofa, a swing -- are endowed with talismanic significance, and throughout the collection he addresses his growing concerns, which inevitably include the political situation in his native Northern Ireland, in a poetry that never ceases to be fluid, alert, and completely truthful.<br><br></p><p>The title of Seamus Heaney&#39;s first collection of poetry since winning the Nobel Prize in 1995 is the term used in Ireland for a carpenter&#39;s level, an earthy physical allusion to matters of spirit that is quintessential Heaney. And indeed this volume deals masterfully with the finding of a level balancing point in ethical, moral, and spiritual affairs. Heaney has famously likened his craft to the farming activities of his childhood, comparing his pen to his father&#39;s spade; here he extends that analogy, comparing the lines of a poem to furrows being plowed in the earth, and &#34;the poem as ploughshare that turns time/ Up and over.&#34; Heaney&#39;s furrows are straight and clean, his loamy lines abundantly fertile.<br>Seamus Heaney received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1995.<br></p><h2>Walt Whitman (Poetry for Young People)</h2><p>ublished by Scholastic, 2002, this oversize First Edition paperback measures 10&#34; by 8 1/2&#34;, with 42 beautifully illustrated pages of poetry.

She has selected works from a diverse group of authors who use different means to portray the nightmarish side of such ordinary human emotions as jealousy, envy and unrequited love. Three of the best tales have never before been published. "Aphra," by Nancy Collins, wittily follows the evolution of the narrator's boyhood fascination with X-Ray Specs into a spooky adult fetish. David Kuehls's morbidly humorous "The First Time" depicts an aging bachelor of the not-far-distant future who finds unwelcome his co-workers' gift of an android to re-enact his first sexual experience. In the sober, affecting "On the Lake of Last Wishes," Claudia O'Keefe writes of a young woman with AIDS who finds sexual fulfillment only in the dream world at the edge of death. Rarely seen classics by Robert Aickman, Arthur Conan Doyle and T.H. White, blend with entries from such modern masters as Harlan Ellison and Ray Bradbury to give this collection a freewheeling variety that highlights the entertainment value of its volatile themes. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Field Guide to the Birds; Eastern land and water birds</h2><p>Sponsored by the National Audubon Society (USA), this is the pre-eminent field guide to identification of birds, specifically in this volume the land and water birds of the Eastern United States.

Her beloved series include Wayfarer Redemption (including the award winning <i>Enchanter</i> and <i>Starman</i>), The Troy Game (beginning with <i>Hades&#x2019; Daughter</i>) and Crucible (with award winner <i>The Wounded Hawk</i>). Her standalone novels include <i> Beyond the Hanging Wall</i> and <i>Threshold</i>.Douglass realizes the world of Tencendor more fully with each volume of the Wayfarer Redemption, but in volume 5 that world is in hideous trouble. The Star Gate has been destroyed, and people and gods alike are helpless against the Timekeeper Demons laying waste to the land. Although deprived of immortality, Drago, a son of the old hero-king, Axis, remains powerful. But as destruction increases, some factions, seeing in Drago's brother, Caelum, the Starson who will restore magic, support Caelum against him. But that magic cannot return unless the demon Qeteb is allowed to ruin the land. The plot developed under those circumstances includes treachery, spectacular magic, near and actual madness in major and minor characters, and lots of action. Drago battles Axis but resists the demons' magic at the cost of much of his sanity. Many beasts are driven mad or wind up with power of their own. Confusion reigns. No place to start the series--that place would be <i>The Wayfarer Redemption</i> (2000)--but crucial for faithful followers. <i>Frieda Murray</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Filled with exuberantly nonsensical made-up words (like "Scroobius Pip" and "pobble"!) that tickle the funny bone, his work gives free rein to youthful imaginations. What better to foster a love of poetry than the immediately appealing The Owl and the Pussy-Cat, with its effortless rhymes, songlike beat, and charming animal characters? Or The Quangle Wangle's Hat, which tells the tale of a creature who warmly welcomes everyone--and so makes everyone cheerful. In Dingle Bank, even some young and mischievous boys punished by their schoolmaster make the best of their situation and succeed in having a good time. Bright and fanciful paintings--all as wildly energetic and unrestrained as the language itself--add to the enjoyment. 20 examples of Lear's finest poems will entice children over and over again--and, as always, this acclaimed series features fascinating biographical information, introductions to each verse, and full annotations that define difficult vocabulary.<br></p><p><p>Academic editor Edward Mendelson is the Lionel Trilling Professor in the Humanities at Columbia, and has taught at Harvard and Yale.

For the past twenty-five years they have actively promoted the cause of conservation in nearly thirty countries in Africa and around the world. Drs. Weber and Vedder are general editors of <i>African Rain Forest Ecology</i> and <i>Conservation</i> (Yale University Press) and authors of dozens of articles and publications. Dr. Weber is director of North America programs for the Wildlife Conservation Society, and Dr. Vedder is vice-president of WCS's Living Landscapes program. They are married and the parents of two sons, and live in New York's Hudson Valley.<b>Chapter One: The View from Bukavu</b> <p> Go ahead. Sit next to him. Adrien deSchryver's suggestion was part tease, part dare. Amy hesitated, then smiled as she began to crawl toward Casimir, a massive silverback scowling at us from beneath a tree about thirty feet away. Surprised by her eager response, deSchryver grabbed Amy by the belt and pulled her back to his side. For the next thirty minutes, we watched Casimir and his family of gorillas from a respectful distance of fifteen to twenty yards. Thick bamboo limited our views to isolated body parts. The gorillas tolerated our presence, but several stayed completely out of sight and all were clearly nervous. Occasional screams ripped the still mountain air. Powerful smells and strange plants enhanced the sensory stew. We were elated. </p><p> Our pygmy guide, Patrice, was calm -- seemingly bored -- throughout our time with the gorillas. But on our hike back to park headquarters he grew more animated when another creature caught his eye. Patrice stalked his tiny prey until it led to an invisible target. Locating the entryway to the bee's nest, he ignored repeated stings as he ripped open the rich ground. Within a minute, he returned to our group with a wide grin on his face and large chunks of dripping honeycomb in his hands. DeSchryver grabbed some moss from a tree and showed us how to soak up the abundant honey like a sponge; Patrice preferred to eat the comb, larvae and all. Soon our faces were smeared with an indescribably exotic mix of flavors and substances. On that late summer day in 1973, we entered the land of gorillas and honey. </p><p> Five years later, we would experience the wonder of sitting peacefully among mountain gorillas in Rwanda -- and the awesome responsibility of trying to save their population from extinction at the hands of humans. But in 1973 we were Peace Corps volunteers in eastern Congo, with much more to learn before we could make any meaningful contribution to conservation. </p><p> We met in 1969 at Swarthmore College and married three years later. Two kids from small towns in upstate New York, we shared the best and worst of the late 1960s and early 1970s. The King and Kennedy assassinations, Vietnam, Kent State, acid rock, Earth Day, Women's Lib, the Generation Gap, and seemingly endless cultural conflict. Through much of that turbulent time, Swarthmore's Quaker tradition was a calming influence. While other campuses went up in flames, our passions were doused with a smothering blanket of Quaker understanding -- and the admonition to use our learning and experience to go forth and make the world a better place. Following graduation, our budding interest in conservation and an urge for adventure led us to Africa via the Peace Corps. We weren't qualified for specialist positions in parks or wildlife management, so we joined more than one hundred other volunteers to be trained as the first teachers sent to Congo, which was then known as Zaire. </p><p> Our arrival in Africa was more eventful than expected. En route from London to begin our Peace Corps training in eastern Congo, we were scheduled to land in the Rwandan capital of Kigali and change planes for a short hop over the border to Bukavu. An overnight coup in Rwanda had closed the airport, however, and we were forced to make an unannounced landing at Uganda's Entebbe airport. This was not a reassuring prospect at a time when Field Marshal, General, and Dictator-for-Life Idi Amin Dada was ruling the former "Black Pearl of Africa" with an increasingly erratic and ruthless hand. Worse, Amin himself was due at the airport at any moment to welcome President Bongo of Gabon. After quickly refueling, we took off and headed west toward Congo. As Lake Victoria shimmered below in the early morning sun, our mood relaxed -- until the pilot announced that we had been told to return to the airport. We later learned that Amin had seen our plane lift off and scrambled two MiGs to reinforce the order to return. Back on the ground, we watched as our suitcases, trunks, backpacks, and guitars were thrown from the cargo hold onto the runway. Ugandan security agents then collected our passports and ordered us to join our belongings on the hot pavement below. There, we were surrounded by at least twenty khaki-clad soldiers bearing AK-47s and persistent scowls. Parental premonitions about the foolhardiness of our African adventure began to seem all too real. </p><p> After two hours of exposure to the equatorial sun, we were ordered inside the small bunkerlike building that passed for Uganda's international airport. Within three years, its layout would be printed on the front page of every major newspaper in the aftermath of the Israelis' "Raid on Entebbe" to rescue a planeload of their own citizens seized by terrorists. Our experience was far less dramatic. We spent more than fifty hours of tension-filled boredom, talking among ourselves, nibbling at a suspect mix of green beans, green French fries, and green meat of unknown origin, while drinking rationed supplies of warm Bell lager beer. Ugandan airport workers cast furtive glances our way and rarely spoke. The few who dared to break the silence asked us not to judge their country by this incident. </p><p> Our curious captivity included the right to watch the Ugandan national news on the airport bar TV each evening. There we learned that we were "mercenaries bound to destabilize Rwanda." This was a strange charge to pin on a group of 112 young Americans, two-thirds of whom were women. To document the threat, Amin appeared in person early on the second morning to take a picture of our increasingly ragtag band with an Instamatic camera that looked ridiculously small in his beefy hands. It fell to President Mobutu Sese Seko of Congo to convince Amin that he was holding nothing more than a group of volunteer schoolteachers. Early on our third day, we were released and flown to the Congolese capital, Kinshasa. </p><p> Meanwhile, the July 5 coup in Rwanda proved to be bloodless, with no outside interference and apparently little internal resistance. Diplomats would later describe the event as a peaceful transition of power from a stagnant clique of southern Rwandan Hutu to their more dynamic cousins from the northern volcanoes region. We paid little attention to such details at the time. We would learn much more about the regional politics of Rwanda in the years to come. </p><p> By some stroke of fate, we were assigned to teach at a small school along the shores of Lake Kivu, partway between the town of Bukavu, where we had received our Peace Corps training, and the Kahuzi-Biega National Park, where we had first seen wild gorillas. We shared a house in Bukavu with another volunteer named Craig Sholley. Sitting on our front porch most afternoons, we watched dramatic storms sweep across the vast expanse of Lake Kivu, its picturesque islands framed by imposing mountains on all sides. The pulsing red glow of the Nyiragongo volcano dominated the evening sky, about seventy-five miles to the north. To the east, the Congo-Nile Divide rose to ten thousand feet to form the rugged backbone of Rwanda. The border with Rwanda was ten minutes from our house, but in the immediate wake of the coup it was rarely open. Congolese and Rwandan residents crossed back and forth between the border towns of Bukavu and Cyangugu, but foreigners were generally not welcome. When Rwanda did open its doors, visitors were required to be clean-shaven, short-haired, and well dressed. We joked that this would assure that no one but CIA agents could enter. Rumors held that ancient tribal animosities and other dark secrets were shielded by the closed border and Rwanda's perpetual cloud cover. Most young travelers who reached Bukavu while wandering across Africa were left to imagine Rwanda's attractions -- including the exotic Nyungwe Forest, where an especially potent form of marijuana was cultivated by the mountain forest dwellers for whom Pygmy Thunder was named. Far to the north, a reclusive American woman was said to live alone among the mountain gorillas that made their home in the Virunga volcanoes. In 1974, we received our only firsthand look at the country during a short transit drive through Rwanda to neighboring Burundi, in the company of an American diplomat. Compared to Congo, it seemed a much less developed country, a simple society where earthen huts with thatched roofs dotted an overwhelmingly agrarian landscape. On that Sunday, though, Rwanda's dirt roads were filled with people: drab men in secondhand Western suits, accompanied by women in flowing robes of dazzling colors. We wondered if they were Hutu or Tutsi. </p><p> Adrien deSchryver was chief warden of the Kahuzi-Biega park. Six years earlier, when Congo's bloody civil war raged around Bukavu, deSchryver was a one-man force for law and order within the park. Poachers had already killed his brother and narrowly missed Adrien himself. Born in Congo (when it was a Belgian colony), with a Congolese wife and family, he was single-mindedly committed to the park and its gorillas. These were eastern lowland gorillas, or Grauer's gorillas as they were sometimes known from their scientific name <i>Gorilla gorilla graueri.</i> They were one of three recognized subspecies of gorilla. The lowland gorillas of west-central Africa were much more numerous, whereas the mountain gorillas on the other side of Lake Kivu were considered the most endangered of the three. But no one really knew how many eastern lowland gorillas existed in the Kahuzi-Biega park, let alone across their range in the surrounding Kivu highlands. DeSchryver wanted a census of the gorillas. He also wanted assistance with his effort to habituate Casimir's group and other gorillas for tourism viewing, which he felt was the only way to save the park from intensive poaching. We had discussed our interest in conservation during earlier visits, but were pleasantly shocked when he asked if we would help with the census and tourism. We jumped at the chance. The Peace Corps was supportive, too, agreeing to fund our positions in Kahuzi-Biega as long as we finished our original two-year commitment as teachers. </p><p> In many...</p></p><h2>Patient H.M.: A Story of Memory, Madness, and Family Secrets</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Oliver Sacks meets Stephen King&#x201d;* in this propulsive, haunting journey into the life of the most studied human research subject of all time, the amnesic known as Patient H.M.

The operation failed to eliminate Henry&#x2019;s seizures, but it did have an unintended effect: Henry was left profoundly amnesic, unable to create long-term memories. Over the next sixty years, Patient H.M., as Henry was known, became the most studied individual in the history of neuroscience, a human guinea pig who would teach us much of what we know about memory today.<br><br> <i>Patient H.M.</i> is, at times, a deeply personal journey. Dittrich&#x2019;s grandfather was the brilliant, morally complex surgeon who operated on Molaison&#x2014;and thousands of other patients. The author&#x2019;s investigation into the dark roots of modern memory science ultimately forces him to confront unsettling secrets in his own family history, and to reveal the tragedy that fueled his grandfather&#x2019;s relentless experimentation&#x2014;experimentation that would revolutionize our understanding of ourselves.<br><br> Dittrich uses the case of Patient H.M. as a starting point for a kaleidoscopic journey, one that moves from the first recorded brain surgeries in ancient Egypt to the cutting-edge laboratories of MIT. He takes readers inside the old asylums and operating theaters where psychosurgeons, as they called themselves, conducted their human experiments, and behind the scenes of a bitter custody battle over the ownership of the most important brain in the world.<br><br> <i>Patient H.M.</i> combines the best of biography, memoir, and science journalism to create a haunting, endlessly fascinating story, one that reveals the wondrous and devastating things that can happen when hubris, ambition, and human imperfection collide.<b><i><br><br></i>&#x201c;An exciting, artful blend of family and medical history.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;</b><i><b><i>The New York Times</i></b><br><br><b>*<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b></i><b>&nbsp;(starred review)</b></b></p><p><b>Luke Dittrich</b> is a National Magazine Award&#x2013;winning journalist, and a contributing editor at <i>Esquire</i>. This is his first book.one<br><br>The Fall<br><br>In the northeast corner of Colt Park, in downtown Hartford, Connecticut, a ten-�foot-�tall bronze statue of the park&#x2019;s namesake rose from a granite pedestal. Engraved tributes to Samuel Colt, inventor of the Colt .45, covered one side of the pedestal, but the boy trudging toward it wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to read them even if he&#x2019;d wanted to, since he wasn&#x2019;t wearing his glasses. It was dinnertime, July 3, and it was probably 1933 or 1934, though the exact year would be one of the things that scientists would argue about in the decades to come. His family&#x2019;s second-�floor walk-�up apartment was about a quarter mile away. He was seven or eight years old and already he&#x2019;d moved at least five times. His father was an electrician, didn&#x2019;t make much money, had to go wherever the work was. It must have been confusing sometimes for the boy, all these homes flashing by, all those fresh starts. He had blond hair and bright blue eyes and a sweet, uncertain smile.<br><br>A steep road skirted the northern edge of the park, and if the boy cut across it and down some backstreets, he could shave a little time off his walk home. The boy&#x2019;s eyesight may have been bad, but there was nothing wrong with his ears. He didn&#x2019;t hear any cars coming. He stepped off the sidewalk and started crossing the road.<br><br>The bicyclist, coasting down the hill, didn&#x2019;t see Henry until it was too late.<br><br>���<br><br>Hippocrates Asclepiades, a Greek physician born on the island of Cos in the fourth century b.c., is widely regarded as the father of modern medicine. Although his last name indicates a claimed family connection to Asclepius, the revered doctor-�god of Greek myth, Hippocrates became famous by advancing the revolutionary argument that the gods had no place in medicine. Healers of one sort or another have existed for as long as humans have, but Hippocrates was one of the first to reject the magic and spiritualism and religion that most who came before him relied on. Instead he attempted to localize the sources of our ailments in our physical environment and inside our bodies themselves.<br><br>That approach was well illustrated in an essay he wrote called &#x201c;On the Sacred Disease.&#x201d; The title was a little misleading, since Hippocrates preferred to call the disease in question by a different name: epilepsy, from the Greek epilambanein, which means &#x201c;to seize.&#x201d; And the disease of epilepsy, he wrote, was &#x201c;no more divine than others; but it has its nature such as other diseases have, and a cause whence it originates.&#x201d; He criticized the &#x201c;conjurors, purificators, mountebanks, and charlatans&#x201d; who used &#x201c;divinity as a pretext and screen of their own inability to afford any assistance,&#x201d; and he ridiculed them for blaming the gods for the various ways epilepsy manifested itself in their patients: &#x201c;For, if they imitate a goat, or grind their teeth, or if their right side be convulsed, they say that the mother of the gods is the cause. But if they speak in a sharper and more intense tone, they resemble this state to a horse, and say that Poseidon is the cause. Or if any excrement be passed, which is often the case, owing to the violence of the disease, the appellation of Enodia is adhibited; or if it be passed in smaller and denser masses, like a bird&#x2019;s, it is said to be from Apollo Nomius. But if foam be emitted by the mouth, and the patient kick with his feet, Ares then gets the blame.&#x201d;<br><br>After rejecting all the sacred explanations, Hippocrates presented a startling explanation of his own: &#x201c;The brain is the cause of this affection,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;as it is of other very great diseases, and in what manner and from what cause it is formed, I will now plainly declare.&#x201d;<br><br>The details of Hippocrates&#x2019;s subsequent explanation of the aetiology of epilepsy, of course, haven&#x2019;t stood the test of time. In his view, the brain was a pneumatic organ, alternately pulsing with phlegm and bile. It was delicately attuned to the winds, and the wrong wind blowing on the wrong person at the wrong time could wreak havoc. If the west wind buffeted a constitutionally phlegmatic child, for example, it might cause the child&#x2019;s brain to temporarily &#x201c;melt,&#x201d; at which point epileptic fits would occur. Hippocrates&#x2019;s prescription for such children would be to shield them from the west wind and expose them instead to the north wind, which would, presumably, recongeal their brains and set them right.<br><br>What&#x2019;s important about Hippocrates isn&#x2019;t that he figured out epilepsy&#x2019;s origins or its treatment&#x2014;�he did neither&#x2014;�but that he began looking in the right place: not up to the heavens or Mount Olympus but into the even more mysterious terrain inside our skulls.<br><br>In the years since, many doctors grappling with the problem of epilepsy followed Hippocrates&#x2019;s lead, venturing deeper and deeper into the brain, seeking a secular understanding of the &#x201c;sacred disease.&#x201d;<br><br>By the early 1930s, when a bicyclist knocked down a young boy on a street in Hartford, Connecticut, they&#x2019;d begun to find some answers.<br><br>Let&#x2019;s imagine ourselves inside Henry&#x2019;s skull.<br><br>Let&#x2019;s imagine the moment after the bicycle hit him and before he hit the ground, when he was neither standing nor lying down but was instead floating through the air.<br><br>His brain was floating, too. It was nestled in a warm pool of cerebrospinal fluid, while vivid sensations of every sort coursed through it. The pain from wherever the bicycle impacted him, the shards of scenery as he was knocked off his feet, the view of the fast-�approaching ground, the sound of his own involuntary gasp, the feel of his wavy hair ruffling as he fell through the air&#x2014;�all of these sensations and more were relaying from the nerves in his retinas, his auditory canals, his skin, his vestibular balance system, and buffeting his brain, which processed them into the multidimensional stew we experience as in-�the-�moment consciousness.<br><br>Now let&#x2019;s imagine the impact.<br><br>Henry landed on the left side of his head, hard enough to tear a deep inch-�long gash in his forehead just above his eyebrow. His brain then experienced what are known as torsional forces&#x2014;�that is, forces that caused it to twist inside his skull, in this case from left to right. At the same time, it sloshed forward in its watery womb, pushing up against the thin membrane of the pia mater and the thicker membranes of the arachnoid and dura mater, its weight compressing them all until it crashed against the unyielding barrier of his skull. His brain deformed. It changed shape exactly like a rubber ball does when it hits a hard surface, and then rebounded. If it was moving fast enough, if the rebound was strong enough, it again compressed the various layers of insulation that usually kept it safe, this time on the opposite side of his skull. This second impact would have been somewhat less violent than the first. And if it rebounded again, to make a third transit, it would be moving even more slowly. Within a second, it stopped its bouncing. The force of the impact dissipated, and Henry&#x2019;s brain was again floating serenely in its warm pool of cerebrospinal fluid.<br><br>But the damage was already done.<br><br>During that first concussive impact and its immediate aftermath, as Henry&#x2019;s brain twisted and compressed and rebounded, various things happened. Some of these things were physical and easy to understand. Neurons and glial cells&#x2014;�the stuff our brains are made of&#x2014;�were torn and ruptured. Other things that happened inside Henry&#x2019;s brain, in that violent moment, were chemical and electrical and harder to explain. For reasons that are still poorly understood, when a brain experiences a combination of torsional forces and blunt-�force impact, like Henry&#x2019;s brain experienced, local clusters of neurons open up their floodgates in lockstep synchrony. Bursts of electricity surge down axons&#x2014;�the slender filaments that stretch out from each neuron&#x2014;�and trigger the release of neurotransmitters at their tips. These neurotransmitters bridge the synapses between the ends of the axons and the waiting dendrites of other nearby neurons, causing those neurons to trigger their own bursts of electricity. Eventually, the growing tsunami of neurotransmitters creates an overwhelming surge of brain activity. Whatever sensations and thoughts were inhabiting Henry&#x2019;s brain prior to this moment&#x2014;�the fear, the pain, the confusion&#x2014;�were wiped out by this burst of activity. Which means that, much like a power surge knocks out a computer, it knocked Henry out.<br><br>For five minutes, nothing. Henry&#x2019;s brain carried on with its usual autonomic, life-�regulating tasks, but wherever his consciousness resided was temporarily shut down.<br><br>Then, slowly, he came back online.<br><br>He opened his eyes. The world came flooding in again, the bustle and noise of downtown Hartford, the voices of a gathering crowd, the pain from the gash in his forehead, the sticky warmth of the blood flowing down his face: The steady march of experience and sensation resumed.<br><br>He was back, but he was not the same.<br><br>The next day was the Fourth of July, and Henry went to a picnic with his family. It was perfect weather for it: warm, no rain. His forehead had been stitched up, and there was a bandage above his left eye. People joked with him about it, asking if he&#x2019;d been playing with firecrackers.<br><br>&#x201c;You must have been up early and got at it,&#x201d; somebody said.<br><br>Henry laughed.<br><br>He seemed fine.<br><br>He felt fine.<br><br>Soon, though, the seizures began.<br><br>While the exact origins of Henry&#x2019;s epilepsy can never be known for sure, many scientists believe that it was related to his fall. It could have been the direct physical damage: When brain injuries heal, the scars left behind have a tendency to become epileptogenic, meaning they can generate epileptic seizures. There&#x2019;s also a theory known as the kindling effect, which holds that the sort of short-�circuiting Henry&#x2019;s brain underwent leaves a new circuit in its wake, a dangerously convulsive circuit, one that grows more active over time, kindling a fiercer and fiercer blaze.<br><br>The seizures were minor at first. Little instants of inattention. Dazed moments, small absences.<br><br>Still, the seed had been planted, and Henry&#x2019;s transformation into Patient H.M., the most studied individual in the history of neuro�science, had begun.<br><br>That&#x2019;s his real name: Henry.<br><br>I can even give it to you complete: Henry Gustave Molaison.<br><br>There was a time I couldn&#x2019;t. It was a secret.<br><br>For almost six decades, the scientists who studied Henry kept his name hidden away. When they wrote about him they were always careful not to reveal too much, for fear that outsiders might find him, and they were successful. There wasn&#x2019;t a single paper, out of the hundreds that chronicled in great detail the experiments performed on Henry during the fifty-�five years between his operation and his death, that contained anything but the vaguest biographical information about Henry himself.<br><br>If you happened to read a lot of these papers, you could have pieced together a fragmentary portrait: One might have mentioned that he had relatives in Louisiana. Another that he was born in 1926. A third that his father&#x2019;s name was Gustave. A fourth that he was an only child.<br><br>And so on.<br><br>But most of his story, starting with that most basic fact of his name, was a tightly guarded mystery to the outside world.<br><br>���<br><br>Henry Gustave Molaison was born in Manchester, Connecticut, on February 26, 1926.<br><br>Two twenty-�six, twenty-�six.<br><br>&#x201c; &#x2019;Least it&#x2019;s easy enough to remember,&#x201d; he often told the scientists with a laugh.<br><br>They prodded him for his birth date over and over, sometimes five, six, seven times during a single session, and though he never remembered the previous time they&#x2019;d asked him, the correct answer always came tumbling out intact: two twenty-�six, twenty-�six.<br><br>Other questions had less consistent answers.<br><br>&#x201c;Henry,&#x201d; a scientist asked him one afternoon, about fifteen years after the experiments began, &#x201c;could you once more describe a little your earliest memory, very early in your life, when you were very small, the very first thing?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, gee,&#x201d; Henry said. &#x201c;There is a jumble right there.&#x201d;<br><br>He paused. He was sitting in a laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, though he didn&#x2019;t know that, and when the scientists had earlier asked where he thought he was, he guessed that he might be in Canada.<br><br>&#x201c;Sort of,&#x201d; he continued, &#x201c;to pinpoint, put them right down in a . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Henry paused again. He was smoking a cigarette.<br><br>&#x201c;Find the one that comes before or after,&#x201d; he said. He had a soft, gentle voice with a thick New England accent. You could almost hear the thoughts whirring inside as he reached back, deep into his childhood. That time, his earliest memory was of a place. A little blue house the Molaison family once lived in.<br><br>Another time, during the same session, responding to the same question, he described a person.<br><br>&#x201c;I can think of my grandfather,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Walking with him. I was very, very small. I think of, uh, well, right off I thought of a tall man, but he isn&#x2019;t, wasn&#x2019;t, tall. Medium-�size. Not heavy-�built. I always think of him in a gray suit. . . . He looked entirely different than my father did, of course. . . . He was, uh, I think of about five-�eight.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your father?&#x201d; the scientist asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Grand,&#x201d; Henry corrected. &#x201c;Grandfather. Because my father was almost exactly six foot, just had, oh, a quarter part of an inch or so to go, and he&#x2019;d be six foot.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How tall are you?&#x201d; the scientist asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I think of six-�two right off.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Pretty tall,&#x201d; the scientist said.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I know I&#x2019;m taller than my father,&#x201d; Henry said.<br><br>&#x201c;Is your father still alive?&#x201d; the scientist asked.<br><br>Henry thought about the question for a few moments before answering. &#x201c;There I have an argument with myself. Right off, I think that he is. And then I have the argument, of course, that I think that he has been called.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not sure?&#x201d; the scientist said.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure,&#x201d; Henry said. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t put my finger, well, definitely on it.&#x201d; He paused again before continuing. &#x201c;He is and he isn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>The scientist made a note of this&#x2014;�Henry&#x2019;s father had died three years before&#x2014;�and then asked once again for his earliest memory.<br><br>&#x201c;Now, Henry, I want you to go back as far as you can, and I want you to try to tell me what you think is your very first, earliest childhood memory, the memory which you think comes before any other.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I can go back to, uh, taking a sleigh ride for the first time. . . .&#x201d;<br><br>He described being on Spruce Street, in Manchester, Connecticut, midwinter. He remembered the sleigh being pulled by a single horse. He thought the sleigh and horse belonged to the father of playmates of his, two brothers, Frankie and Jimmie. As he told the story, he picked up the pace, added more details, lost himself in the memory. The horse was on its way to a stable to be reshod. Frankie and Jimmie and Henry were nestled warmly in the back. Some other local kids, seeing them go by, threw snowballs, but the walls of the sleigh kept them safe.</p><h2>The Beginner&#39;s Bible for Toddlers</h2><p><p>The Beginner&#x2019;s Bible�, the bestselling Bible storybook of our time, now in a special edition just for toddlers.

Learn to release them in this extraordinary book.</p><p>Born in 1891, Claude M. Bristol served as a soldier in WWI in France and Germany. He worked in the army newspaper until 1919. Later, he was a businessman in Portland, Oregon, and a popular speaker in clubs and business organizations among others.<p></p><p></p><p><i>The</i> <br>MAGIC <br><i>of</i> <br>BELIEVING</p><p>(1948)</p><p>With an Introduction by Palmer Hoyt, Editor and Publisher, <i>The Denver Post, </i>Denver, Colorado; Member, United States Air Policy Commission</p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;HOW I CAME TO TAP THE POWER OF BELIEF<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;MIND-STUFF EXPERIMENTS<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;WHAT THE SUBCONSCIOUS IS<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;SUGGESTION IS POWER<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;THE ART OF MENTAL PICTURES<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;THE MIRROR TECHNIQUE FOR RELEASING THE SUBCONSCIOUS<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;HOW TO PROJECT YOUR THOUGHTS<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;WOMEN AND THE SCIENCE OF BELIEF<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;BELIEF MAKES THINGS HAPPEN</p><p></p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>&#x201c;The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves, that we are underlings.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;SHAKESPEARE</p><p>Generally speaking, people are more interested in themselves and their success than anything else. For this reason Claude M. Bristol&#x2019;s book, <i>The Magic of Believing</i>, ought to enjoy widest readership.</p><p>In simple straightforward language, Mr. Bristol has set forth some basic principles of the fuller use of the mind in achieving practical objectives. He has illumined these potential uses with a wealth of descriptive instances, many of them based on his own personal experiences and observations embracing many years as a newspaper man and a successful business executive. He has traveled extensively over the world and has long investigated and studied what he calls &#x201c;Mind Stuff.&#x201d;</p><p>Claude Bristol has been helping people to help themselves for twenty years and I have been conversant with what the author has done with his theme during the period. I am also conversant with persons mentioned in this interesting book and with various successes they have achieved.</p><p>Mr. Bristol believes deeply that any person can achieve any given aim if he believes strongly enough and he presents a well documented case to prove his point. He makes no claim to being a &#x201c;mental healer,&#x201d; but his observations on the relationship of mind to health are of more than passing interest.</p><p><i>The Magic of Believing</i> does not delve into the occult. At the same time it does not limit the possibilities that telepathy and the use of the subconscious present.</p><p><i>The Magic of Believing</i> should be an inspiration to any one who reads it carefully because, in its development and its documentation, it is a clear picture of how the great potential possibilities of the mind may be utilized to achieve the ambitions of anyone interested.</p><p>Having served in World War I as well as having had a part in the war effort where I came in close contact with service people of World War II, and being aware of potential postwar problems, I should like to see a copy of this book in the hands of every ex-service man and woman as well as all others sincerely interested in making a place for themselves in the years to come.</p><p>PALMER HOYT</p><p>Editor and Publisher</p><p><i>The Denver Post</i></p><p>Denver, Colorado</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>Is there a something, a force, a factor, a power, a science&#x2014;call it what you will&#x2014;which a few people understand and use to overcome their difficulties and achieve outstanding success? I firmly believe that there is, and it is my purpose in this, first complete exposition of the subject, to attempt to explain it so that you may use it if you desire.</p><p>About fifteen years ago the financial editor of a great Los Angeles newspaper, after attending lectures I had given to financial men in that city and after having read my brochure, <i>T.N.T.&#x2014;It Rocks the Earth,</i> wrote:</p><p>&#x201c;You have caught from the ether something that has a mystical quality&#x2014;a something that explains the magic of coincidence, the mystery of what makes men lucky.&#x201d;</p><p>I realized that I had run across something that was workable, but I didn&#x2019;t consider it then, neither do I now, as anything mystical, except in the sense that it is unknown to the majority of people. It is something that has always been known to a fortunate few down the centuries, but, for some unknown reason, is little understood by the average person.</p><p>When I started out years ago to teach this science through the medium of lectures and my brochure, I wasn&#x2019;t certain that it could be or would be grasped by the ordinary individual; but now that I have seen those who have used it double and triple their incomes, build their own successful businesses, acquire homes in the country, and create sizable fortunes, I am convinced that any intelligent person who is sincere with himself can reach any heights he desires. I had no intention of writing a second book, although many urged me to do so, until a few months ago, when a woman in the book business, who had sold many copies of my first little book, literally &#x201c;read the riot act&#x201d; to me, declaring:</p><p>&#x201c;You have a duty to perform to the ex-service men and women, and all others who seek places for themselves in a postwar world, to give them in easily understood form not only what you contained in your <i>T.N.T.</i>&#x2014;<i>It Rocks the Earth</i> but the new material that you have given in your lectures. Everyone of ambition wants to get ahead and you have amply demonstrated you have something that will help anyone, and it&#x2019;s up to you to pass it along.&#x201d;</p><p>It took time to sell myself on the idea, but having served as a soldier in World War I, mostly in France and Germany, and having been an active official for many years in ex-service men&#x2019;s organizations as well as a member of a state commission to aid in the rehabilitation of ex-service men and women, I realized that it would be no easy task for many individuals to make outstanding places for themselves in a practical world from which they had long been separated. It is with them in mind, as well as all ambitious men and women, and with a sincere desire to help, that I write this full and detailed exposition of the power of belief.</p><p>I am cognizant of the fact that there are powerful forces at work in this country that would dominate us, substituting a kind of regimentation for the competitive system which has made America great among nations. They would attempt to destroy individual thinking and initiative, cherished ever since our Pilgrim Fathers established this country in defiance of Old World tyranny. I believe that we must continue to retain the wealth of spirit of our forefathers, for if we don&#x2019;t we shall find ourselves dominated in everything we do by a mighty few and shall become serfs in fact if not in name. Thus this work is written also to help develop individual thinking and doing.</p><p>Since I am aware that this book may fall into the hands of some who may call me a &#x201c;crackpot&#x201d; or a &#x201c;screwball,&#x201d; let me say that I am past the half-century mark and have had many years of hard practical business experience, as well as a goodly number of years as a newspaper man. I started as a police reporter, and police reporters are trained to get facts and &#x201c;accept nothing for granted.&#x201d; For a two-year period I was church editor of a large metropolitan newspaper, during which I came in close contact with clergymen and leaders of all sects and denominations, mind-healers, divine healers, Spiritualists, Christian Scientists, New Thought-ers, Unity leaders, sun and idol worshipers, and, yes, even a few infidels and pagans.</p><p>Gypsy Smith, well-known English evangelist, was making an early tour of America at that time, and as I used to sit night after night on his platform, watching people stumble down the aisles, some sobbing, others shouting hysterically, I wondered.</p><p>Again I wondered as I accompanied the police in answering a riot call when some Holy Rollers in a moment of hysteria knocked over a stove and set fire to their meeting hall. When I attended my first and only meeting of Shakers, I wondered as I did while attending various spiritualistic meetings. I wondered as I heard the testimonials at the Wednesday night meetings of Christian Scientists. I wondered when I witnessed a group of white people being immersed in the icy waters of a mountain stream and coming up shouting &#x201c;Hallelujah,&#x201d; even though their teeth were chattering. I wondered at the ceremonial dances of the Indians and their rain-calling programs. Billy Sunday also caused me to wonder, as in later years did Aimee Semple McPherson.</p><p>In France during the first war I marveled at the simple faith of the peasants and the powers of their village padres. The stories of the so-called miracles at Lourdes, as well as of somewhat similar miracles at other shrines, also held great interest. When I saw elderly men and women in a famous old Roman church climb literally on their knees up a long flight of stairs to gaze upon a holy urn&#x2014;a climb that is no simple task for an athletically trained young person&#x2014;I wondered again.</p><p>Business brought me into contact with the Mormons, and when I heard of the belief in the story of Joseph Smith and the revelations on the plates of gold, I was again given to wonderment. The Dukhobors of western Canada, who would doff their clothes when provoked, likewise made me wonder. While in Hawaii I heard much about the powers of the kahunas who, it was claimed, could, by praying, cause people to die or live. The great powers attributed to these kahunas profoundly impressed me.</p><p>In my early days as a newspaper man I saw a famous medium try to make the &#x201c;spirits&#x201d; respond before a crowded courtroom of antagonistic scoffers. The judge had promised the medium he would be freed if he could get the &#x201c;spirits&#x201d; to speak in the courtroom. They failed to materialize and I wondered why, because the medium&#x2019;s followers had testified to remarkable prior s�ances.</p><p>Many years later I was commissioned to write a series of articles on what is known in police parlance as the &#x201c;fortune-telling racket.&#x201d; I visited everything from gypsy phrenologists to crystal-ball gazers, from astrologers to spiritualistic mediums. I have heard what purported to be the voices of old Indian &#x201c;guides&#x201d; tell me the past, the present, and the future, and I heard from relatives I never knew existed.</p><p>Several times I have been in a hospital room in which people around me died, while others with seemingly no worse ailments were up and apparently fully recovered within a short time. I have known partially paralyzed people who claim they have cured their rheumatism or arthritis by wearing a copper band around their wrists&#x2014;and have known others who claimed a cure by mental healing. From relatives and close friends I have heard stories of how warts on hands have suddenly disappeared. I am familiar with the stories of those who permit rattlesnakes to bite them and still live, and with hundreds of other tales of mysterious healings and happenings.</p><p>I have, moreover, made myself familiar with the lives of great men and women of history; I have met and interviewed many outstanding men and women in all lines of human endeavor; and I have often wondered just what it was that took them to the top while others were lost in obscurity. I have seen coaches take apparently inferior baseball and football teams and infuse them with &#x201c;something&#x201d; that caused them to win. In the depression days I saw sales organizations, badly whipped, do an abrupt about-face and bring in more business than ever before.</p><p>Apparently I was born with a huge bump of curiosity, for I have always had an insatiable yearning to seek explanations and answers. This yearning has taken me to many strange places, brought to light many peculiar cases, and has caused me to read every book I could get my hands on dealing with religions, cults, and both physical and mental sciences. I have read literally thousands of books on modern psychology, metaphysics, ancient magic, Voodooism, Yogism, Theosophy, Christian Science, Unity, Truth, New Thought, Cou�ism, and many others dealing with what I call &#x201c;Mind Stuff,&#x201d; as well as the philosophies and teachings of the great masters of the past.</p><p>Many were nonsensical, others strange, and many very profound. Gradually I discovered that there is a golden thread that runs through all the teachings and makes them work for those who sincerely accept and apply them, and that thread can be named in the single word&#x2014;<i>belief.</i> It is this same element or factor, belief, which causes people to be cured through mental healing, enables others to climb high the ladder of success, and gets phenomenal results for all who accept it. Why belief is a miracle worker is something that cannot be satisfactorily explained; but have no doubt about it, there&#x2019;s genuine magic in believing. &#x201c;The magic of believing&#x201d; became a phrase around which my thoughts steadily revolved.</p><p>I am convinced that in the so-called secret fraternal organizations there is a real &#x201c;royal secret&#x201d; which very few members ever grasp, and the conclusion must be that &#x201c;no mind ever receives the truth until it is prepared to receive it.&#x201d; I am convinced also that some of these organizations, like many secret orders which have a knowledge and an understanding of life, use parables and misinterpretations to mislead. In one order, candidates are provided with a very profound book (to be studied in connection with the degree work), which itself would be well-nigh an open-sesame to life if these candidates would understand and follow its tenets; but few read it, complaining that &#x201c;it is too deep&#x201d; for them.</p><p>When <i>T.N.T.&#x2014;It Rocks the Earth</i> was first published, I imagined that it would be easily understood, as I had written it simply; but as the years went by I found that some readers protested that it was too much in digest form, while others said they couldn&#x2019;t understand it. I had assumed that most people knew something about the power of thought. I was mistaken, and I realized that those who had an understanding of the subject were comparatively few. Later in my many years of lecturing before clubs, business and sales organizations, I discovered that while most people were vitally interested in the subject, it had to be fully explained. Finally, I undertook to write this book in words that anyone who reads can understand and with the hope that it will help many to reach their goal in life.</p><p>The science of thought is as old as man himself. The wise men of all ages have known about it and used it. The only thing the writer has done is to put the subject in modern language and bring to the reader&#x2019;s attention what a few of the outstanding minds of today are doing to substantiate the great truths that have come down through the centuries.</p><p>Fortunately for the world, people generally are coming to the realization that there is &#x201c;something to this mind-stuff after all,&#x201d; and the writer believes that there are millions of people who would like to get a better understanding of it and prove that it does work.</p><p>Therefore, I start with relating a few experiences of my own life, with the hope that by hearing them, you will gain a better understanding of the entire science. Early in 1918 I landed in France as a &#x201c;casual&#x201d; soldier, unattached to a regular company. As a result it was several weeks before my service record, necessary for my pay, caught up with me. During that period I was without money to buy gum, candy, cigarettes, and ...</p></p><h2>Heart of the Christos: Starseeding from the Pleiades</h2><p><br>The author faces archetypal, cosmic lords within herself.&nbsp; These inner lords are a reflection of humankind's age-old struggle with "the gods who came down to Earth," who intervened with human reality and limited our freedom.&nbsp;</p><p>Barbara Hand Clow is an internationally acclaimed ceremonial teacher, author, and Mayan Calendar researcher.

Noir tradition casts a long, influential, and even daunting shadow. Alfred D�blin's and Christopher Isherwood's works, some of Bertolt Brecht's plays, the </i>Morgue<i> poems by Gottfried Benn, </i>M<i> by Fritz Lang, and many other narratives from the first third of the twentieth century, all of which are tinged with noir, set high intellectual standards, and literary and aesthetic benchmarks that are hard to surpass...</i></p><p><i> Neither D�blin nor Benn, Brecht nor Lang, catered to any crime fiction traditions. They merely steeped their literary projects in a great deal of noir. And so it is with most of the stories in our anthology: they do not necessarily follow the usual patterns of crime fiction, but regard noir as a license to write as they wish, a certain way of approaching the city, and a prism through which its nature is viewed...What's left is history. It is omnipresent in Berlin at every turn; the city is saturated in a history full of blood, violence, and death.</i></p></p><p><p><b>Thomas W�rtche</b>, born in 1954, is a literary scholar, critic, and was director of several crime fiction publishing imprints.

Of these, the six colonies in the Caribbean&#x2014;Jamaica, Barbados, the Leeward Islands, Grenada and Tobago, St. Vincent; and Dominica&#x2014;were among the wealthiest. These island colonies were closely related to the mainland by social ties and tightly connected by trade. In a period when most British colonists in North America lived less than 200 miles inland and the major cities were all situated along the coast, the ocean often acted as a highway between islands and mainland rather than a barrier.</p><p>The plantation system of the islands was so similar to that of the southern mainland colonies that these regions had more in common with each other, some historians argue, than either had with New England. Political developments in all the colonies moved along parallel tracks, with elected assemblies in the Caribbean, like their mainland counterparts, seeking to increase their authority at the expense of colonial executives. Yet when revolution came, the majority of the white island colonists did not side with their compatriots on the mainland.</p><p>A major contribution to the history of the American Revolution, <i>An Empire Divided</i> traces a split in the politics of the mainland and island colonies after the Stamp Act Crisis of 1765-66, when the colonists on the islands chose not to emulate the resistance of the patriots on the mainland. Once war came, it was increasingly unpopular in the British Caribbean; nonetheless, the white colonists cooperated with the British in defense of their islands. O'Shaughnessy decisively refutes the widespread belief that there was broad backing among the Caribbean colonists for the American Revolution and deftly reconstructs the history of how the island colonies followed an increasingly divergent course from the former colonies to the north.</p></p><p>Andrew Jackson O&#39;Shaughnessy is the Saunders Director of the Robert H.Smith International Center for Jefferson Studies at Monticello and Professor of History at the University of Virginia.<p>Chapter One<br>British Sojourners</p><p>At the outset of the American Revolutionary War, a French visitor remarked on the differences between the island and mainland colonies of British America: "Far from settling in the islands," the white colonists regarded them "as a land of exile, never as a place where they plan to live, prosper, and die." In contrast, the Anglo-American colonists of the mainland were "permanent, born in the country and attached to it; they have no motherland save the one they live in."</p><p>Writing a century earlier, a Barbadian planter spoke of this umbilical attachment in which "by a kind of magnetic force England draws all to it.... It is the center to which all things tend. Nothing but England can we relish or fancy." In 1760, Charles Townshend favorably contrasted West Indians to North Americans because they "never consider[ed] themselves at home" in the islands and they sent "their children to the Mother Country for education." They eventually returned to Britain "to recover their health or enjoy their fortunes" for, if they had ambition, "tis hither they come to gratify it."</p><p>In 1764, following the end of the Seven Years' War, a Nevis author reflected on the transient quality of white society in the islands: "Tho' detained from their native land by mercenary Pursuits and Views of Interest, yet [they] consider their Absence from Britain as an Exile, and incessantly sigh for a return." Upon joining his regiment in Jamaica, Lord Adam Gordon commented that "the generality of its inhabitants look upon themselves there as passengers only." Bryan Edwards similarly described how "it is to Great Britain alone that our West India planters consider themselves as belonging." He added that "even such of them as have resided in the West Indies from their birth, look on the islands as their temporary abode only, and the fond notion of being able to go home (as they emphatically term a visit to England) year after year animates their industry and alleviates their misfortune."</p><p>Colonists throughout British America spoke of Britain as their home. The expression was more meaningful in the British West Indies, however, where the white settlers were primarily a society of sojourners who aimed to return to Britain and identified themselves culturally with Britain. I shall argue that the strength of the social and cultural ties with Britain restrained the development of a nationalistic creole consciousness among whites and was a contributory factor in the failure of the British Caribbean to support the American Revolution.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Whites in the British Caribbean were creoles, if we mean simply that they made cultural adaptations to their new environment. Like European settlers elsewhere in the Americas, they possessed distinctive characteristics in their speech, diet, dress, architecture, values, and behavior that were peculiar to the Caribbean. They developed an attachment to their islands, which was reflected in the numerous prerevolutionary local histories and a literature praising the tropical landscape. They were often ambivalent about their British identity when they actually returned to the mother country.</p><p>But West Indian whites were not committed to permanent settlement, and their ideal of returning home to the mother country gave white society a transient quality. They treated the islands as little more than temporary abodes to facilitate their spectacular reentry into British society. Throughout the eighteenth century, an increasing proportion of West Indian planters returned to live off the income of their plantations as absentees in Britain. The trend varied among islands, often in relation to the respective expansion and profitability of sugar production. It began in Barbados soon after the Restoration of Charles II (1660). In the last two decades of the seventeenth century, some three hundred west Indians were annually going back to Britain "with this advantage that their fathers went out poor and the children come home rich." Over one-third of Jamaican planters were absentees by 1740.</p><p>In the 1730s, absenteeism was still quite rare in the Leeward Islands (Antigua, St. Kitts, Montserrat, and Nevis). Thereafter it reached chronic levels in St. Kitts, where absentees owned half the property in 1745. Absenteeism was also prevalent in the Windward Islands (Grenada, St. Vincent, Dominica, and Tobago) from the time of their acquisition by Britain in 1763. Tobago had only twenty resident planters out of a total of seventy-seven proprietors. Absentee estates in Grenada were worth upward of a million pounds of sterling in 1778.</p><p>On the eve of the American Revolution, planter-historian Edward Long estimated that there were some two thousand nonresidents, annuitants, and proprietors, "who of late years" and "beyond the example of former times" had flocked from Jamaica to Britain. A visitor found St. Kitts "almost abandoned to overseers and managers, owing to the amazing fortunes that belong to Individuals, who almost all reside in England." Absentees made up 80 percent of the elite families of Antigua, and two-thirds of the planters in Jamaica were absentees by 1800. Absenteeism was also common among military officers, the clergy, and patent officeholders.</p><p>These British sojourners consequently bequeathed shamefully little toward developing an infrastructure in the islands, such as schools, colleges, roads, and missions. The most enduring visible monuments to the presence of the British in the Caribbean were those commemorating the deaths of individuals who died before achieving their ambition of returning home. Some were crafted by the best English sculptors, such as Henry Cheere and John Bacon. They all shared a common feature in the complete absence of any depiction of tropical life in the West Indies. The patrons clearly wanted to be commemorated by monuments exactly like those of an English country churchyard. These decaying monuments remain English corners of a foreign land.</p><p>The transience of white West Indian society was reflected in the paucity of architectural remains. Edward Long spoke of the "make-shift" appearance of the architecture in Jamaica, and Bryan Edwards described the "meanness of their houses and apartments." There were "few of the Beauties of Architecture to be seen in Jamaica" despite the opulence of its planters. James Anthony Froude, a nineteenth-century historian, was appalled at the difference between Kingston, the largest town in the British West Indies, which "has not one fine building in it," and Havana, the Spanish capital of Cuba, which "is a city of palaces, a city of streets and plazas, of colonnades and towers, and churches and monasteries." The most impressive architectural eighteenth-century legacies were not private residences but fortresses, naval dockyards, and military barracks. "We English," Froude concluded, "have built in those islands as if we were but passing visitors, wanting only tenements to be occupied for a time."</p><p>West Indian fortunes nurtured several noted writers and scholars, but they too were often sojourners. They included bibliophiles, historians, political pamphleteers, constitutional authorities, political economists, travel writers, natural historians, botanists, and agricultural commentators. There were West Indian members of the Royal Society, the Dilettante Society, and the Royal College of Physicians. The first complete oratorio in the Americas was composed and performed in Jamaica in 1775. There were also poets, landscape artists, actors, architects, and connoisseurs. Spanish Town in Jamaica had a theater, circulating libraries, a literary society, an agricultural society, and social clubs in the 1770s. West Indian literary and artistic work may indeed have "fostered local pride," but most of these authors and scholars were either visitors, temporary residents, or absentees. They also were often transients, thereby creating the popular misconception that "in literature, science and the arts, the history of the British West Indies is almost a blank."</p><p>It was the ephemeral nature of white settlement that so concerned Edward Long, the most incisive of contemporary commentators. His History of Jamaica (1774) pleaded for greater self-sufficiency and the development of local institutions. He advocated legislative action to fund schools, a medical college, white immigration, improved military defenses, and a stronger church foundation. His emphasis on greater self-sufficiency was his most original intellectual contribution "not his political ideas per se" or his "constitutionalism." However, even Long succumbed to the temptations of absenteeism and returned to Britain.</p><p>Only in Barbados did the British come close to developing a creole society of committed settlers in the Caribbean. This was due to the high proportion of whites, less reliance on immigration, the belief that the climate was more healthy, lower rates of absenteeism, lower sugar profits, lower rates of "miscegenation," less danger from foreign attack (owing to the windward position), and complacence about the threat of a black rebellion. Barbados contained the largest proportion of small and middling planters, numbering some four thousand resident landowners in 1765. It had a better infrastructure with the oldest assembly in the British Caribbean, the first printing press, schools in every parish, the first newspaper, and a well-supported Anglican Church.</p><p>Barbados has been used as a case study to show the early development of a creole mentality in the eighteenth-century British Caribbean. Even in Barbados, however, the white population was in a minority. Almost one-third of the planters were absentees like Samuel Estwick, Philip Gibbes, John Gibbons, and the Lascelles. The Barbadian elite preferred to be educated in Britain; thus Codrington College never "promised to make it unnecessary for Barbadian youths to travel to England for advanced education." It closed as a school between 1775 and 1786 and was not a university or even a seminary until 1830. The yeoman class of small landholders lacked the confidence to politically challenge the planter elite until the early nineteenth century.</p><p>* * *</p><p>How do we explain the transience of British society in the Caribbean and the almost universal desire of whites to return home to Britain? Frank Wesley Pitman argued that the absence of religious motives among the first English settlers in the Caribbean created a transient society, which was in contrast to North America, where religion inspired ideals of a new society divorced from England. He also suggested that the settlers in the islands were drawn from "the capitalist class . . . [who] were often connected with the landed gentry, were Anglicans, and championed the social and political conceptions held by the rural aristocracy of England," in contrast to the North Americans, "who came largely from the middle and nonconformist class in England . . . [and who] had imbibed democratic and republican ideas."</p><p>Pitman, in an error common among his generation, treated the history of colonial America as synonymous with the Puritan colonies of New England and ignored the more populous plantation colonies of the Chesapeake (Virginia and Maryland). There was in reality little difference in the motives and background of the early English emigrants to the Caribbean from those of the Chesapeake. The plantation colonies of the islands and the southern mainland shared a common ethos, which was materialistic, individualistic, competitive, exploitative, and comparatively secular. It was the universal aim of most settlers in all the plantation colonies to make quick fortunes and to return to a life of genteel leisure in Britain.</p><p>The peculiar transience of British society in the Caribbean can be attributed in part to demographic failure. The white population was not sustained by natural increase, unlike the mainland colonies where the white population was doubling every twenty-five years after 1700. Deaths exceeded births in the Caribbean. The migration of a little under half a million Europeans to the British Caribbean was "roughly comparable" to that of British North America before the American Revolution. Yet there were fewer than fifty thousand whites in the British Caribbean, compared to two million in North America, in 1776.</p><p>The demographic failure of white society in the islands was linked to the high mortality rates: "The low life expectancy of white men in the tropics goes far to explain the large number of absentee proprietors" and the small size of the white population. Jamaica was "considered the most unhealthy [place] . . . in the world." Over one-third of white immigrants died within three years of arriving in the Caribbean. A posting in the islands consequently occasioned sudden rises in the military sick lists and even mutinies in the army in Britain. Being stationed in Jamaica became a form of punishment. The danger of sudden death was a constant topic of conversation among passengers on a voyage to the West Indies in 1775. Hector St. John de Cr�vecoeur wrote of West Indians who at the age of thirty were "loaded with the infirmities of old age" and losing the "abilities of enjoying the comforts of life at a time when we northern men just begin to taste the fruits of our labour and prudence." The grim prospect of a premature death was a powerful deterrent to living in the Caribbean.</p><p>Influenced by the humoral theory of medicine, European settlers feared, above all, the tropical "climate of our sugar islands," which they found "so inconvenient for an English constitution that no man will choose to live there, much less will any man choose to settle there [in the Caribbean]." They blamed the heat for causing high mortality rates, but in reality, the majority fell victim to malaria and less commonly to the more lethal yellow fever epidemics. Whites had less immunity to these diseases than did blacks.</p><p>The high mortality rates of native whites were a cause of fragile family formations that also contributed to the transience of white society. Premature deaths cut short marriages, which typically lasted little more than eight years in Jamaica. The majority of children died in infancy or in childhood. The size of families was consequently very small.</p><p>Even so, British immigrants continued to be a major component of white society in the Caribbean. Opportunities were good in the professions and in trades, owing to the demographic failure of the native white population, the lack of skilled white artisans, and the limited educational infrastructure within the islands. Furthermore, Jamaica and some of the Windward Islands were still frontier settlements with uncultivated land before the American Revolution.</p><p>Young white immigrant males from Britain were a dominant element in the white population of Jamaica. Their presence contributed to the unbalanced sex ratios and compounded the problem of fragile family formations. There was "a whole parish [in Jamaica] without a married Man" and another parish where there was "not to be found above one married couple." Young British males who arrived as indentured servants were often more highly skilled than those of the southern mainland colonies.</p><p>The Scots were the second largest group of immigrants after the English. They made up one-third of the ...</p></p><h2>Lost Lion of Empire</h2><p>Ewarr Grogan, a gentleman adventurer dubbed 'the boldest and baddest of a bold, bad gang' of pioneering settlers in Kenya, was gifted far beyond the ordinary. Possessed of disarmingly good looks, magnetic charm, a formidable intellect and a near boundless ego, he was famed throughout the British Empire as one of the most brilliant - and controversial - figures of African colonial history.<br>By the age of twenty-two Grogan had been elected the youngest ever member of the Alpine Club and was a Matabele War veteran. But his prospects were far from certain when he fell in love with a young heiress and was required by her stepfather to prove himself a 'somebody' in order to win her hand. Grogan's response was typically unequivocal: he announced that he intended to be the first man to complete a south-to-north traverse of the African continent. In 1900, after almost three years of adventure and unimaginable hardship, he arrived triumphantly in Cairo, thus completing one of the most astonishing feats in the history of the African exploration. He became an instant celebrity and returned to London to marry his beloved Gertrude.</p><p><p>Ewart Grogan, 'the baddest and boldest of a bad bold gang' of settlers in Kenya, was one of the most brilliant and controversial figures of African colonial history.</p><p>When he proposed to a young heiress, Gertrude Coleman, he needed to prove himself a 'somebody' to her father in order to win her hand.

The battle, a major German offensive, caught the allied forces off-guard in Belgium, France, and Luxembourg and, lasting from December 1945 January 1945, had devastating consequences for both sides. There were eighty-nine thousand Americans casualties and between eighty thousand and one hundred thousand German ones. It was the largest and bloodiest battle fought by the Americans during the war and, yet, in the end, an allied victory.<br><br>There are Western accounts of the battle, but very little has been told from the German perspective. In <i>Hitler&#x2019;s Ardennes Offensive</i>, acclaimed military historian Danny S. Parker has compiled together accounts by German officials who reveal how they perceived the battle, how they believe Adolf Hitler perceived it, and what, in their opinion, went wrong.<br><br>The assessments featured include ones from Nazi leaders such as SS-generals Josef Dietrich and SS-Brigadef�hrer Fritz Kr�mer, and they are paired with nine rarely seen photographs and three maps.

Amsterdam is the font of liberalism, in both its senses. Tolerance for free thinking and free love make it a place where, in the words of one of its mayors, "craziness is a value." But the city also fostered the deeper meaning of liberalism, one that profoundly influenced America: political and economic freedom. Amsterdam was home not only to religious dissidents and radical thinkers but to the world's first great global corporation.<br> <br> In this effortlessly erudite account, Russell Shorto traces the idiosyncratic evolution of Amsterdam, showing how such disparate elements as herring anatomy, naked Anabaptists parading through the streets, and an intimate gathering in a sixteenth-century wine-tasting room had a profound effect on Dutch-and world-history. Weaving in his own experiences of his adopted home, Shorto provides an ever-surprising, intellectually engaging story of Amsterdam from the building of its first canals in the 1300s, through its brutal struggle for independence, its golden age as a vast empire, to its complex present in which its cherished ideals of liberalism are under siege.</p><p>RUSSELL SHORTO is the bestselling author of <i>Descartes' Bones</i> and <i>The Island at the Center of the World</i> and is a contributing writer at the <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>. He lives in Amsterdam.CHAPTER 1<br><br>A Bicycle Trip<br><br>A day in Amsterdam begins with me leaving my apartment with my toddler son in my arms, strapping him into his seat between the handlebars of my bicycle, working his blocky little sneakered feet into the footpads, then setting off through the quiet, generally breezy streets of our neighborhood, which is called Oud Zuid: Old South. You could look at the work of any Dutch master for an idea of the morning light we cycle through. There is a white cleanness to it, a rinsed quality. It's a sober light, without, for example, any of the orange particulate glow you get from the Mediterranean sun. The houses of the neighborhood are three- or four-story brick buildings, all constructed in the first two decades of the twentieth century, when what was then a vigorously working-class city, one that still smelled of herring and roasting coffee beans, expanded rapidly around its central core of canals.<br><br>We cycle past street-level apartments, some of which, following a Dutch tradition that I like to think has to do with an ingrained commitment to openness, feature a central uncurtained window that puts the living room on public display, as if the family who lives there thinks its life is worthy of a museum. For a while I didn't understand why, when we reach the part of the route that has us riding alongside a canal, my son would break out in a series of high screeches. Then I realized Anthony was imitating the gulls that squeal as they do their crazy arcs and dives above the water.<br><br>We pass a few businesses. The bakery is usually scenting the morning air with cinnamon as we ride by. The display windows of the corner bicycle shop exhibit sturdy, gleaming new models, lately in an array of pastel tones, by Gazelle and Batavus, factories that have been turning out Dutch bicycles for a century. An open door to the right of the windows leads down to the basement, and the repair shop, whose interior I know too well. The grooves in the concrete at both sides of the stairway leading below are meant for bicycle tires.<br><br>Once in a while I will vary the route and turn down along the Hobbemakade, where on our right is a slightly forlorn-looking stretch of canal, with weeds growing up through the quayside where rickety houseboats are moored, and on the left are the remnants of one of the smallest and least noticeable of the city's several red light districts. De Wallen--Amsterdam's central red light district--is a sort of alternate-universe Disneyland, noisy and with a certain ragged cheer, visited not only by drunken male tourists but also by couples strolling arm in arm and even families. Here, by contrast, there are only three or four of the display windows that the city's licensed prostitutes sit in to exhibit themselves, in the midst of what is otherwise a residential street. I never get how customers would know to find them. Nevertheless, even in the morning there is often at least one woman on duty, wearing a swimsuit, sitting on a stool, smoking, or listlessly punching the keys of a cell phone. Sometimes she will wave at Anthony and give him a little smile. The other window might be empty save for a stool with a towel folded on the seat that is crumpled in a way that looks like it has been sat on. Such details--the crumpled towel, the bored look of the woman facing a long day of staring into the street, punctuated by short intervals of sex with strangers--bring the city's infamous tolerance of vice out of the realms of sensationalism and idealism and into the realm of the deeply mundane. As with any other place, living here for a time causes the exotic to collapse under the weight of ordinariness. Two doors down is another storefront business, an advertising agency whose name--Strangelove--you might think is intended as a wry commentary on the neighbors, but I would bet not. I'll bet they don't even notice.<br><br>Amsterdam School is the name given to the style of architecture that was pioneered in my neighborhood as it was coming into being. The style has a formal aesthetic, which has its technical descriptors and philosophical (socialist) underpinnings, but to me it simply embodies a reasonably pleasant combination of whimsy and stolidness. Brick (what could be more stolid?) is the medium, yet there is an infinity of playful variations: rounded turretlike corners, embedded deco-ish sculptures that seem to mock the hardness of the material (a girl surrounded by rabbits, a baby holding up a doorway), block-long apartment buildings that could have had an ocean liner as their inspiration, or a wedding cake.<br><br>The neighborhood is no more than five minutes by bike from the canal belt and the storied seventeenth-century heart of Amsterdam, but when developers were laying it out a hundred years ago they must have felt a need to connect the new area to the city's history. If Rembrandt visited the immediate area around my home he might feel some familiarity, for even though this was swamp and fields in his time the streets bear the names of many of the artists whom he groomed in his workshop or competed with for commissions: Frans van Mieris, who wrought exquisite small portraits of the wealthy class; Nicolaas Maes, who often painted ordinary people at prayer and at meals and gave the same loving attention to a glistening loaf of bread or an earthen pitcher on a table as he did to the faces of his subjects; Philips Wouwerman, who specialized in hunting scenes and was known to paint a mean horse.<br><br>At the time my neighborhood came into being, all of those were figures of the grand past, so that the names Nicolaas Maesstraat and Frans van Mierisstraat instantly gave the new neighborhood some of the luster of Amsterdam's age of glory, when it was--briefly and improbably--the greatest city in the world. To this day the houses on those streets have dignified presence. But as you go farther away from the center, as we do on our morning trip, the houses get plainer. It seems the city fathers of a century ago did not want to dilute the grandeur of the golden age by spreading its names too far. On the other hand, in 1905, right at the time that the more distant part of the neighborhood was being laid out, the nearby Stedelijk Museum, the city's modern art museum, mounted the first exhibition in the country devoted to Vincent van Gogh. The Dutch artist had died only fifteen years before; his home country had done its best to ignore him, but it was now obvious that they would have to pay attention. Yet at the same time, his name didn't carry bourgeois heft--and who knew if those thick swirls of bright color would withstand the test of time? As a result of what I imagine were considerations such as these, Vincent van Goghstraat--the only street in the area whose name is instantly, globally recognizable today--is among the humblest: a single block of monotone dwellings.<br><br>That street also signals the end of our little journey. As Anthony and I pass it, I hop off the bicycle, unstrap him, and set him on the sidewalk. While I ring the doorbell, he opens the mailbox flap, which is on his level, and hollers into it. The door is opened by a Moroccan woman in her thirties, wearing a head scarf, floor-length robe, and sandals. She has a kind face and smiles at Anthony as she tells him he's grown over the weekend: "Nou, wat een grote jongen ben je!" He plays a game, trying to scramble up the stairs to the next floor instead of going into her apartment. Iman and her husband have lived in Amsterdam for ten years. They have two young daughters. Her husband drives a city bus; she is a licensed gastouder: literally, "guest parent," what in the United States would be called a day care provider. Her four-year-old, Marwa, emerges from behind her, with a tangle of curls and big deep eyes, and says hello over and over, very loudly. Then she tells me Anthony is ugly. Then she gives him a hug and hauls him into the apartment.<br><br>Iman and I chat for a few minutes. Some weeks before she asked if Anthony's mother and I would sign an immigration document in support of her sister, who wanted to come to Amsterdam to visit. I was confused at first: I thought one was required to get such statements of support for people who intended to emigrate, not who merely wanted to visit family. I subsequently learned that it was now necessary in the Netherlands for people from certain countries (read poor countries--or, to be more precise, Muslim countries) to file extensive applications, including having residents vouch for them, even if all they wanted to do was see the canals and tulips. We signed the form. Then a few weeks later Iman said her sister's application had been denied. The reason given: she was "onbetrouwbaar"-untrustworthy. When Iman asked, through an immigration lawyer, for clarification, she was told that because of "ties" in the country it was feared that her sister might stay in the Netherlands. Iman was confused by this. She and her husband were legal residents of the Netherlands. They paid taxes. The family spoke Dutch at home. They were, as they say, playing by the rules. Yet their legal residence itself was deemed a reason for untrustworthiness. Much later, the decision was reversed, and Iman's sister was allowed to visit, but such is a conundrum of our era: a city famed historically for championing the notion of tolerance now seemed to be charting odd new frontiers of intolerance.<br><br>Once a week, after I've left Anthony in Iman's care, I don't return directly home but spend the morning exploring another, quite different frontier of intolerance. Taking another route, I pull up at a corner of the Beethovenstraat (now having reentered the tonier part of the district, whose precincts are suited to grand names--nearby are Rubenstraat and Bachstraat), peruse the street corner florist's kiosk, buy a bunch of variegated tulips or mauve roses, and ring a doorbell a few steps away. Upstairs, I am met by an elderly woman with short steel-gray hair, a sharply angled jawline, and darting, birdlike eyes. Her name is Frieda Menco. We exchange the standard Dutch greeting of three kisses, I hand the flowers to her, she protests mildly that I shouldn't have, then we enter her apartment. The living and dining rooms are wide, very bright, and sparsely filled with modernist furniture. A spread is laid out on the coffee table: cookies, chocolate, a pot of coffee and two cups, a jug of water, a vase of flowers.<br><br>We sit. I turn on my recorder. We exchange small talk. Then she turns her face toward the watery sunlight pouring in through the windows and says, "Now, where was I?"<br><br>Someone outside is shouting--no, a lot of people, confused voices. The train lurches suddenly; the packed bodies sway; people scream. Frieda is sixteen and for two days and nights has sat scrunched on the lap of a middle-aged man whom she doesn't know. The cattle car is so crammed with people that the atmosphere would seem to be one of horror, but instead the press of inexorable power brings on a wave of colossal deadness. The air is clotted with the reek of their waste--a barrel in the corner has been the communal open toilet. It sits perversely high, so in order to relieve herself she not only has to endure the public nature of a private act but must balance herself on its rim and try not to knock it over. There are no windows in the car, and when the door is slid shut there is no virtually no light; the air is dark and stifling as death. Occasionally she catches a glimpse of her parents where they sit wedged on the other side of the car--their eyes frightened but still holding the hard, almost uncrushable nugget of hope in them. She is their only child.<br><br>Finally, she is outside, standing on the ground. More shouts--real chaos in the distance. And there--a gallows, a human body, hanging, swaying in space. People over there are running now, screaming. Here, they are being jostled into lines. Now some are pushing into them--they are Jews like them but who know the routine, everyone wearing blue-and-white-striped prison uniforms--whispering hard into their faces: If you have anything of value, give it to me, because they will take it from you. Some of the newcomers hand over their jewelry; she gives nothing because she has nothing. They are formed into four lines: two of women and girls, two of men and boys. She and her mother are in one line, to the far right, then comes the other female line--though she doesn't know it yet, this second line, holding people who were quickly deemed not fit for work, is headed directly into the gas chamber--and she spots her father in the third line. Soldiers and dogs keep people in place: those uniforms, the Stahlhelm, the helmet with its infamously and menacingly scooped curve. But no, these things didn't register that way yet, didn't have the heavy meaning they would take on.<br><br>A grim geometry problem is on display, taunting her to find a solution: as the people lurch forward, the space between where her father stands in his line and where she and her mother are in their line grows wider.<br><br>Then, improbably, out of character, she sees her father seem to calculate, reach a rash decision. He has lunged--he is moving across that open space, obliterating that vacuum, passing through the second line of women that stands between his line and hers, defying the gray-uniformed soldiers with their helmets and guns. He is here, breathing, his face--a soft, round, gentle face--close to her. His is an artistic soul, bent by necessity toward commerce. Joel Brommet is a professional window dresser, who also gives correspondence courses in graphic design. Frieda is his joy. She helps him with his work, cranks the mimeograph machine that occupies a corner of their Amsterdam living room, running off the inky-smelling sheets, each with a carefully typed lesson, each beginning, "Worthy student," folds the packets, and stuffs them into brown envelopes to be sent to towns and villages around the country, to young people who hope to escape farming or fishing for a life with a touch more glamour. She would sometimes make trips with her father to stores to observe his latest work. He showed her how he crafted every detail of a window display: the price tags, the signs ("Speciale prijs! 13 ct."), mannequins posed just so. Frieda's earliest memory is of him. She is maybe three years old, happy and sleepy in her bed in their comfortable middle-class apartment. "Will you catch the moon for me, and put it on the cupboard?" She still remembers that cupboard and what a nice ornament she thought the silver disc of the moon would make sitting on top. He answers: "If you sleep like a sweet little girl, I'll fetch a long ladder and get the moon for you."</p><h2>Opening Night</h2><p>A London actor was dying for a star billing...<br><br>From the leading lady's liaison to the harassment of an aging juvenile lead-there's never a dull moment, darling, at the Vulcan Theatre.

The reproductions are of exceptional quality and are printed on heavy, glossy paper. Instead of inspiring, however, the book overwhelms. Each page in the ten sections is crammed with several poems, photos of artwork, information about the artwork, information about the poet and often an "explanation" of the poem that reduces it to its most simplistic level, robbing it of its mystery and richness.

He wrote more than twenty books of poetry, including <em>Quick Question; Planisphere; Notes from the Air; A Worldly Country; Where Shall I Wander; </em>and <em>Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror, </em>which received the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, the National Book Critics Circle Award, and the National Book Award. The winner of many prizes and awards, both nationally and internationally, he received the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters from the National Book Foundation in 2011 and a National Humanities Medal, presented by President Obama at the White House, in 2012. Ashbery died in September 2017 at the age of ninety.</p>If Ashbery's last several books have tended to sound the same, it could be because they indicate a restlessness to express something that won't quite come out, "a murky, milky precipitate/ of certain years." In the 58 lyrics of his 26th book of poems, Ashbery (<i>Where Shall I Wander</i>, 2005) shows his complete mastery of his late idiom: associative leaps ("Everything has a silver lining; it's a matter/ of turning it over and scrubbing some sense into it"), flippant philosophical statements ("Much will be forgiven those/ on whom nothing has dawned") and chatty quips ("I say, would you mind if I light up in bars?"). Surprises include the cleverly rhymed title poem and a lovely metaphysical piece called "Litanies": "It is important to be laid out/ in a man-made shape. Others will try/ to offer you something&#x2014;on no account/ accept it." There is no trademark long poem, but many of these short pieces forebodingly acknowledge that "the dark/ wants, needs us." While the mood elsewhere in this book often seems light, these poems are more about the failure of, or provisional failure of, lightness. Still inimitably questioning, Ashbery continues to inhabit a worldly country all his own. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Mad egomaniacs, hilariously writing their memoirs in advance&#x2015;or poor fools ensnared by a blackmailer? Rich material, in any case. But when its pompous director, Sir Quentin Oliver, steals the manuscript of Fleur's new novel, fiction begins to appropriate life. The association's members begin to act out scenes exactly as Fleur herself has already written them in her missing manuscript.

Spark's involved plots, unhurried pace, and willingness to poke at the intricate eccentricities of human behavior are well served by Nadia May's reading. May easily manages the story's complex, numerous strands: Fleur's frequent discussion of the writing process, art's mirroring of life, and the book's many characters. It's a credit to May that we can keep track of the wealth of personality and detail Spark offers; May's throaty narration is particularly well suited to portrayals of the story's many elderly characters, especially the wonderfully eccentric Lady Edwina.

For more information, visit www.danielle-staub.com<b><b>INTRODUCTION</b></b> <p>The headline on the flyer handed to me at the Chateau hair salon in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, said &#x201c;Jersey Girls: My Fabulous Life.&#x201d; It was advertising the casting of a new televised reality show, and the flyer created quite a buzz among all the local girls, who imagined that their &#x201c;fabulous&#x201d; suburban lives would fascinate audiences everywhere. My reaction was quite the opposite: &#x201c;My life sucks, so no thanks.&#x201d; </p><p>Six months later, I was again approached about appearing on the reality show. The only show airing on Bravo within the <i>Housewives</i> franchise at the time was <i>The Real Housewives of Orange County</i> and I hadn&#x2019;t seen it, but it had gotten a stamp of approval from my eldest daughter, Christine (who has become my &#x201c;go-to&#x201d; girlfriend for all of my big decisions), so I checked the show out for myself. I definitely liked what I saw. </p><p>After viewing an episode, I found it offered refreshing insight into families as well as friendships among married and single women alike. Single moms on the show were going through their problems while getting advice and support from their castmates. This made me think I should consider participating in the show. </p><p>In the beginning, I believed being on <i>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</i> was going to be an uplifting, quirky, fun, joining-of-the-hands experience that would perhaps entail a little drama shared by all of us. I soon found out how wrong I was. I became the focus of a character attack delivered at the hands of those who would, I thought, be holding mine in friendship. As the first season played out, my castmates&#x2019; biggest source of ammunition was a book (that came to be referred to as <i>&#x201c;the</i> book&#x201d;)&#x2014;the expose written about my first husband, Kevin Maher. </p><p>Ironically, being exposed on TV forced me to reconcile my present with my past and realize that those experiences, for better or worse, made me who I am today. As I dealt with the scrutiny of my castmates, something clicked. People were taking so much interest in someone else&#x2019;s take on my life that I decided they would perhaps like to know how it had <i>really</i> happened. And my fellow housewives had no right to turn what was my tortured past into the present. I realized that if the public had this much interest in my life, then it was time that I told my story in my own words. There are no two sides to one&#x2019;s life story. If you didn&#x2019;t live it, it&#x2019;s not yours to speak of. don&#x2019;t want to pretend or claim to be a voice for every housewife. But I have a voice and I intend to use it. I will lend my life as an example for others. </p><p>I get notes every day from people who pour their hearts out to me about their own challenges and how they can relate to my life&#x2019;s struggles on many levels. These are the people whom I wrote this book for, as well as my children and myself. Every story that&#x2019;s been written about me&#x2014;and there have been a lot&#x2014;has been edited. This book is the <i>unedited</i> version of my life. What you read in the following chapters is what happened the way I remember it. </p><p>In this memoir, I&#x2019;m finally baring it all. The title, <i>The Naked Truth,</i> doesn&#x2019;t refer to being naked without clothing. It means naked as in stripped down and laid bare. It means naked without skin&#x2014;totally raw to the bone. That&#x2019;s exactly what this book is. No matter what has happened in my life, good or bad, I am now in a place where I can make some sense out of it and hopefully help some others to do the same.

William Marcy Tweed didn't invent graft, but he rigged elections and stole from the public on an unprecedented scale, gaining a stranglehold on New York City and amassing a vast personal fortune. By the early 1870s, he and his "ring" had skimmed between $25 and $40 million from the municipal treasury, a staggering amount even in an era notorious for robber barons and market manipulators. Ackerman, the author of The Gold Ring: Jim Fisk, Jay Gould, and Black Friday 1869, a book about two other Gilded Age scoundrels, deftly chronicles Tweed's epic rise and ultimate disgrace, giving us a nuanced portrait of the "Boss." Early in his career, Tweed brilliantly recognized that he could win power by mobilizing New York's teeming working-class and immigrant wards. Through patronage and largesse, Tweed recruited an army of ballot-box stuffers who helped install his cronies in office, allowing him to award jobs and contracts to friends while punishing enemies. Tweed's ring borrowed vast amounts on the city's tab and spent lavishly on such public projects as Central Park, making Tweed "the city's grand benefactor, Santa Claus with a diamond pin." But while Ackerman gives Tweed his due, describing how the Boss's machine aided the poor and helped modernize a crowded, chaotic city, the author is too clear-eyed to present his subject as a latter-day Robin Hood. Ackerman's Boss Tweed robbed everyone-and kept plenty for himself. And ultimately, Tweed's corruption and fiscal recklessness had crippling consequences for the city long after he died, penniless, in jail. In the end, this book is not only a compelling look at the colorful yet ruthless man who invented the big city political machine, it is also the gripping story of how dedicated newspapermen and zealous reformers brought down a notorious kingpin. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

That is its weakness. The aftermath of Reagan's presidency has proved, over and over, that Reaganism without Reagan is unsustainable. Even with him, it was a tottering edifice. He had inherited multiple tendencies rather than a single movement. In the 1950s, William F. Buckley Jr. made conservatism intellectually respectable, jettisoning its anti-Semitic and anti-intellectual baggage. In the 1960s, Barry Goldwater made the movement politically viable by bringing into the Republican party a South that was resisting racial integration. Nixon combined these efforts, joining a sophisticated form of anticommunism with a Southern strategy based on the backlash from civil rights. But even before Watergate, Nixon's synthesis was coming apart. His and Kissinger's opening to China, their detente and arms-control efforts, offended the fundamentalist branch of Nixon's constituency, which was apocalyptic in its hatred of all Marxist regimes.</p> <p>Reagan united the fissiparous movement around his radiant personality. He comforted the comfortable and disarmed the afflicted. He was too obviously nice to mean whatever meanness appeared in his programs. He gave conservatism the elements it had signally lacked&#x2014;humanity, optimism, hope. Buckley had wit, but of a chilly sort. Goldwater's followers had passion, but it was the anguish of those who feel persecuted. Nixon had intelligence, but it was cramped by paranoia. Reagan, without much wit or passion or intelligence, had a humanity that made up for anything he lacked. He was the firsttruly cheerful conservative, and America is a country that does not recognize itself unless it sees, in the mirror, a confident face looking back at it. When William F. Buckley founded National Review in 1955, he said that its task was to stand "athwart history yelling Stop!'" Reagan was never comfortable with a purely obstructionist conservatism. He was too swoony over the wonders of science and technology. In one of his favorite stories, a student issued him this challenge: "You didn't grow up in an era of space travel, of jet travel, of cybernetics, computers figuring in seconds what it used to take men years to figure out." Reagan triumphantly produced this response: "It's true . . . we didn't grow up, my generation, with those things. We invented them." When Reagan worked for General Electric, he let the company make his home a well-advertised display of the company's latest luxury products. Many of the items showcased there went into G.E.'s Carousel of Progress, created with Walt Disney for the 1964 World's Fair in New York&#x2014;which, in turn, was absorbed into Disney's Tomorrowland at the Magic Kingdom. Progress was always Reagan's favorite product.</p> <p>A parable for Reagan's brand of conservatism could be fashioned from his rejection of the historic Lincoln Steffens house, lived in by former governors of California. He had a new place built with the help of financial backers, one with all the modern conveniences. That is what Reagan did, symbolically, for conservatism itself&#x2014;took it from its historic home and gave it a new operating center. Some of the charm he found in the Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star Wars, was precisely its complex of barely conceived technologies. He hated nukes, partly because they were old-fashioned. He loved lasers, partly because they were so "far out" as to remind him of the ray gun in his old Brass Bancroft serials. With his repeated mantra that "Nothing is impossible," he believed that technology could make the space weapon entirely benign&#x2014;so incapable of offense that we would give it, for free, to the Kremlin.</p> <p>Older-style conservatives were not comfortable with Reagan's fondness for a citation from the radical Tom Paine: "We have it in our power to start the world over." Reagan also said: "I don't think we ought to focus on the past. I want to focus on the future." He said that about the Holocaust, in connection with his visit to a German cemetery with the graves of storm troopers in it, but it expressed his confident futurism. The cognitive scientist George Lakoff claims that conservatives think of themselves as punitive parents, while liberals think of themselves as caring parents. But President Reagan was benign and grandfatherly in style, not harsh and retaliatory&#x2014;in this regard, more a Democrat like Franklin Roosevelt than a dour Calvin Coolidge. And his resemblance to Roosevelt was not merely a matter of sunniness. Reagan had to disarm his followers as well as his foes when he made surprising departures from conservative doctrine.</p> <p><br> </p> <p>1</p> <p>Roosevelt campaigned on a promise to cut spending and balance the budget. Instead, his first term increased spending&#x2014;significantly, but not on Reagan's scale. Reagan nearly tripled the deficit in his eight years, and never made a realistic proposal for cutting it. As the biographer Lou Cannon noted, it was unfair for critics to say that Reagan was trying to balance the budget on the backs of the poor, since "he never seriously attempted to balance the budget at all." Even Reagan's ideological ally and defender, George Will, made no effort to defend him on this. The six budgets Reagan had most control over "produced deficits totaling $1.1 trillion," Will wrote. "The budgets Reagan sent to Congress proposed thirteen-fourteenths of that total. Congress added a piddling $90 billion a year."</p> <p>It is claimed that Reagan brought down the Soviet Union by forcing it to spend so much on defense that it collapsed. Perhaps. But in the process he made America spend so much on its military that interest payments on the national debt more than doubled (according to Will, "a regressive transfer of wealth to buyers of government bonds"), savings dropped, and cutbacks caused severe neglect of the national infrastructure. Even when the cold war was over, few in America seemed to be celebrating. It is not given to many presidents to spend two world empires toward decline.</p> <p>How on earth did a Republican, an enemy of "big government," give us the greatest government debt ever? No single cause can explain such a mystery. But the elements of disaster arranged themselves around a campaign ploy the Reagan team rejected in 1976 as too kooky but eagerly adopted in the 1980 race&#x2014;the "supply side" claim that tax cuts pay for themselves in increased productivity. This notion was given a visual aid (always helpful with Reagan) when the idea- merchant Arthur Laffer drew his famous curve on a napkin.</p> <p>Reagan entertained the exhilarating Laffer heresy without giving up Republican orthodoxy on the balanced budget, smaller government, and no inflation. Supply- side purists could accept on principle any short-term deficits while tax cuts had time to generate greater productivity. But that was asking too much of Reagan, whose life had been spent preaching (though not practicing, even as governor) frugality. Jude Wanniski, the supply-side guru, was able to satisfy this orthodox Reagan with a second doctrine, that of an inflation-busting stable money supply. (Actually, what Wanniski wanted was a return to the gold standard.)</p> <p>David Stockman, the man asked by Reagan to sell the supply-side tax cuts to Congress, later complained that he was given, in effect, two napkins to reconcile&#x2014;the Laffer Curve napkin and the gold-standard napkin&#x2014;and the two were irreconcilable. To make things worse, Stockman had to accommodate another part of Reagan's constituency&#x2014;the neoconservative Committee on the Present Danger, which claimed that Jimmy Carter had engaged in unilateral disarmament. The only way to cure that was by major leaps upward in defense spending. Stock- man was being lobbied by his friend George Will, whom he called "adamant" on the need for huge defense expenditures. Caspar Weinberger, Reagan's defense secretary&#x2014;his reputation as "Cap the Knife" notwithstanding&#x2014;was determined to flex financial muscle even before he knew what the new money would be buying. During the campaign, Reagan had called for a 5 percent increase in the Pentagon budget, but in the aftermath of Carter's attempt to rescue hostages in Iran ("Desert One"), the outgoing Administration had itself upped defense costs by 5 percent in its 1981 budget. Sitting in Weinberger's office with his pocket calculator, Stockman suggested a 7 percent increase. Weinberger said, "In light of the disgraceful mess we're inheriting, 7 percent will be a pretty lean ration." Stockman sweetened the deal by figuring the annual raises from the projected Reagan defense budget of 1982, not the lean Carter budget of 1980. Stockman had been doing this, in other areas, to construct rosy scenarios, counting on income down the line from supply-side magic. That produced lower projected costs elsewhere, but it had the opposite effect for defense&#x2014;a fact that Stockman discovered, with chagrin, after the Reagan military budget worked out to a 10 percent increase in real growth over six years, ending up with 160 percent higher outlay by 1989. It was too late to cancel the announced rates&#x2014; the last thing Reagan would do is back off on defense. Stockman says he groaned when he saw that "they were squealing with delight throughout the military- industrial complex."</p> <p>Stockman became a sorcerer's apprentice as each problem "solved" created another one. For instance, cutbacks that slowed inflation led to revenue losses not at first counted on, since inflation had, through "bracket creep," raised the annual tax intake. It was hard to make the numbers work with that income, too, going down. Stockman gave up, at one point confessing to the journalist William Greider, "None of us really understands what's going on with all of these numbers." His own forecasts were "absolutely doctored," he said.</p> <p>It did not end there. Another Reagan belief that mired Stockman in deficits was the deregulation mania. Stockman considered it a blessing that his cuts would force...</p></p><h2>Stitching Stars: The Story Quilts of Harriet Powers (African-American Artists and Artisans)</h2><p>An illustrated biography of the African American quilter who made quilts of her favorite Bible stories and folktales</p><p></p><h2>The Barbed Crown: An Ethan Gage Adventure (Ethan Gage Adventures)</h2><p><p>In <em>The Barbed Crown</em>, the sixth tale of rogue and adventurer Ethan Gage by William Dietrich, our hero returns to Paris and London.

With Dr. Mercola's grain-free diet, readers will discover the key to permanent weight loss and healthy living, beginning with: <br><br> * The 3-Day Diet-Eating every two hours to rid the body of grains, sweets, and starches<br> * The 50-Day Diet Plan-Eating four to six meals a day to normalize cholesterol levels<br> * The Lifelong Maintenance Plan-Following specific food guidelines that allow certain grains to be slowly brought back into the diet<br> * Plus: The Emotional Freedom Technique-a craving-busting tool for eliminating carbohydrate cravings and addictions once and for all. <br><br> Forget the pain and frustration of high-protein, low-fat diets that don't work and aren't even good for you. You'll watch the pounds come off as The No-Grain Diet takes you to the next level of health, fitness, and well-being.</p><p>Impressively modern in design, <i>The No-Grain Diet</i> brings a realistic viewpoint to the problems of weight loss in a genuine effort to improve the health of an ever-growing number of obese people. Offering a variety of "food plans," along with a set of techniques aimed at controlling emotional eating and cravings for "bad" foods, Dr Joseph Mercola clearly understands how to motivate--in one section, he suggests that rather than "living by the scale," we measure our success in relation to the fit of our favourite pair of slightly-too-snug jeans. Many recipes are included, most of which are free of the boring flavour substitutes so common in diet books. <p>The diet itself combines several familiar concepts. The "no grain" model emphasises organic vegetables and quality protein, with limited fruits and absolutely no simple carbs. Mercola's idea of "quality protein" is somewhat startling--he is deeply concerned about toxins, and urges grass-fed beef over potentially mercury-filled fish. His main point is frequently reinforced: refined grains of any type are basically deadly and eating them should be viewed as an unhealthy addiction. </p><p>Here, the book veers off in a new direction: rather than gently nudging our habits in a new direction, he suggests we break what he insists is an addictive cycle with a method called "EFT," or "Emotional Freedom Technique." As a way to avoid surrendering to desires, his system of tapping acupressure points and repeating affirmations is used to overcome them. While repeat dieters will understand the necessity of examining emotional ties to food, Mercola's voice becomes a tad strident, and possibly downright offensive to those with a different opinion on what constitutes an addiction. <i>--Jill Lightner, Amazon.com</i></p>'...this book does an exceptional job of culminating his decades of wisdom, experience and success to truly help you lose weight, fight and prevent disease, and have boundless energy... if you are seeking a dietary plan that will truly help you lose weight and be healthy - permanently - read this essential book!'

It instantly became a sizzling, international bestseller that lanced the boil of Windsor family dysfunction, triggering a chain of events that led to Charles and Diana's divorce. After her tragic death in 1997, Andrew Morton revealed that Diana herself had not only been the main source for the book, but had also edited his original drafts for accuracy. In return for this gold mine of information, Diana wanted complete anonymity for fear of retaliation from the queen. <i>Her True Story in Her Own Words</i> is enhanced by more than 75 full-color photographs of the princess, from her childhood in Althorp to her marriage to Charles at Westminster Abbey to her humanitarian efforts, and finally to her unforgettable funeral service. However, the most poignant portrayal of the princess emerges from the unedited transcriptions of Diana's interviews with Morton: "I think I'm going to cut a very different path from everyone else. I'm going to break away from this setup and go and help the man on the street."<p>The sudden and tragic death of Princess Diana has caused the entire world to reflect on how much this singular woman meant to us all. From her fairy-tale courtship, her wedding to Prince Charles, and the birth of her two wonderful boys to the stunning collapse of her marriage and the revelation of her psychological and physical trauma, we witnessed and shared in the wide range of emotions in her life. In the last few years, Diana's dedication to the downtrodden and unloved and her commitment as a mother have only strengthened her hold on our hearts. </p><p>When <i>Diana: Her True Story</i> was initially published in 1992, it was met with a hail of abuse from the British Establishment. As time passed, however, the magnitude of Diana's marital and personal distress made it clear, even to the greatest doubters, that this book was indeed Diana's true story; and finally, in 1995, she revealed in a BBC interview that she had indirectly cooperated with Andrew Morton. </p><p>What has not been known, however, until the publication of this new edition, is that <i>Diana: Her True Story</i> was in fact almost entirely based on her own words, supplemented by interviews with her friends. In 1991 and 1992, when this book was first conceived and written, Diana felt trapped and powerless within the royal family. She knew that the truth about her life was submerged under a mountain of royal propaganda. <i>Diana: Her True Story</i> chronicles Diana's unhappiness, which began shortly before her wedding day, and reveals the life of a young and beautiful woman who, trapped in a loveless marriage, had sunk to the depths of despair; from which recovery seemed impossible. In an act of desperation, she made the decision in 1991 to tell her own story, no matter what the cost. And so she and Andrew Morton began a collaboration that was to shake the royal family to its foundations and, eventually, force Diana to seek a new life. Tragically, that new, and briefly happy, life is over. </p><p>This new edition contains the story of how the book first came into being. What's more, Diana is able, finally, to tell her own story, in her own words. Its pages contain her own testament -- the closest we will ever come to her autobiography.</p></p><h2>A Natural History of Love</h2><p>The bestselling author of A Natural History of the Senses now explores the allure of adultery, the appeal of aphrodisiacs, and the cult of the kiss.

Malliet delivers all that<i>.</i>" &#x2015;Marilyn Stasio, <i>The New York Times</i></p><p>Last year, Agatha Award-winning author G. M. Malliet charmed mystery lovers, cozy fans, and Agatha Christie devotees with <i>Wicked Autumn, </i>the first mystery featuring her captivating protagonist, Max Tudor, and the small English village of Nether Monkslip. </p><p>In <i>A</i> <i>Fatal Winter, </i>Max&#x2015;Anglican priest, former MI5 agent, and village heartthrob&#x2015;investigates two deaths at Chedrow Castle. But his growing attraction to Awena Owen complicates his case, as does the recent arrival at Chedrow Castle of a raucous group of long-lost, greedy relatives, any one of whom has a motive for murder. With a cozy setting, intricate puzzles, and a handsome (non-celibate) priest doing the sleuthing, the books in this series are destined to become instant classics in the mystery world.</p></p><p><i>A Fatal Winter</i> is the second book in the Max Tudor series. The first in the series, <i>Wicked Autumn</i>, is currently nominated for an Agatha Award, and was one of five books shortlisted for the Dilys Award (an award given by booksellers for the book they most enjoyed selling during the previous year).<br><br>G.M. Malliet won the Agatha Award for her first St. Just mystery, <i>Death of a Cozy Writer</i>, which initially won the Malice Domestic grant.<b>CHAPTER 1</b><br><b><i>Ticket to Ride</i></b><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>DECEMBER 13&#x2014;MORNING</b><br>Max Tudor, returning to Nether Monkslip from a routine mission on a bitterly cold but beautiful December day, was not to know he would be pulled into the investigation of strange events at nearby Chedrow Castle&#x2014;an investigation that would haunt many of his future nights.<br>At the little self-service kiosk at Waterloo station, Max&#x2019;s biggest concern was what to eat to fortify himself for his hours-long journey. He hesitated over a slice of marzipan cake tightly wrapped in cling film. It made him think of the Battenberg sold by Sainsbury&#x2019;s, a sponge cake with not so much icing as a thick slab of sweetened concrete which had not completely set. That cake had been one of his guilty pleasures ever since he was a child. This imposter of a cake had the concrete yellow icing but not the pink-and-yellow-checkered pattern to its layers. Reluctantly, Max passed it by.<br>He scanned the display of food for something marginally more nutritious, but this particular outpost of British Rail offered the kind of sandwich that left you wondering if an ambulance could bully its way through the crowded London streets in time to save you.<br>He was returning from a symposium in London, where he&#x2019;d delivered a short, well-received talk on the need to preserve Britain&#x2019;s churches. English Heritage had recently launched an initiative to save such Grade I and Grade II listed structures and somehow Max&#x2019;s name had come up as someone having experience in these matters. Roofing and timber and masonry repairs to churches in Great Britain were endless and ongoing, and the skilled workmen needed to make the repairs dwindling in number. Worse, in some cases, the lead and copper from roofs were being stolen, so the venerable old edifices were being demolished piece by piece.<br>As the vicar of a small church steeped in antiquity and unparalleled beauty, Max felt he would be negligent not to exploit every avenue to funds to pay for its upkeep. If becoming some sort of expert within the inner circle of preservationists would help, so be it.<br>Although the symposium had gone well, he soon found himself longing to return to his isolated little village with its little frictions. Well, he thought (here hastily pushing aside the memory of a recent murder in the village) <i>mostly</i> little frictions.<br>For London seemed to be slowly turning into a madhouse. Almost, it seemed, in honor of his first foray into the city in months MI5 had raised the terror alert level to severe. Which meant not a lot these days in the face of ongoing threats from more than one group in more than one part of the world. A general acceptance of the fact the world had forever changed on 9/11 seemed the best that could be hoped for from a public worn cynical and wearied by a stream of heightened precautions. Besides, a recommendation for extra alertness seemed de trop when Max by nature was seldom not alert, watching, waiting&#x2014;for what he could not have said.<br>He had stayed at a London hotel booked for him by the diocese with an eye on the bottom line&#x2014;very bottom&#x2014;as if left to his own devices Max might stop at Claridge&#x2019;s and order jeroboams of champagne sent up to his suite. The place chosen for him did not even pretend to have once been a star in the galaxy of the hospitality industry; no deposed barons of even very minor baronetcies were to be found taking tea in the lobby. The place had always been shabby about the edges and now was unapologetically shabby through and through. He had been greeted by the receptionist, a gum-chewing girl of surly disposition obviously forced to work beneath her level of unrecognized genius. It may have been a job she held for the school break, although she had the look of an actress between jobs, all sparkly mascara and languorous, studied movements. There had been a certain accretion of interest in her eyes as she took in the handsome features of her new guest. The gum chewing stopped abruptly, only to be resumed as she cogitated the question he put to her. No, she didn&#x2019;t think they had a room with a view. She&#x2019;d check. She began flapping her long painted nails about on a keyboard and came up with the expected answer: All the rooms with views were full up.<br>At least, he reflected, the hotel had a plain, old-fashioned lift with deeply padded sides&#x2014;none of these modern horrors made of glass, apparently conceived as a trial for people who are afraid of heights. The last time he&#x2019;d had reason to stay in London, the hotel lift had been made of stainless steel with water cascading artistically down the sides&#x2014;it was like being hoisted aloft in a high-tech colander.<br>Max, on seeing his forlorn, seedy London hotel room, longed momentarily in an all-too-human way for something gilt-edged and dripping with crystal chandeliers. But in particular he longed for the cozy if fussy and old-fashioned study of his vicarage, which he told himself now was at least rich in character.<br>Instead he was in an ancient London hotel whose lack of amenities in no way inhibited the management from charging an exorbitant amount for a dollhouse-sized room with no view. It was an amount that should have lent itself to luxury terry cloth robes and shower caps folded into little boxes and shampoos from the official Shampooers to Her Majesty, and yet Max was grateful to have been provided a postage stamp-sized bar of soap made from, apparently, tar and ground pepper. The room boasted a bed with a single thin mattress that might have been stuffed with straw, and a radio so old it had probably first been used by someone listening to King Edward VIII&#x2019;s abdication speech. It had dials as big as scones and speakers covered in a dusty open-weave fabric like burlap. The hot water in the bathroom was as close to nonexistent as made no difference, and the breakfast the next morning made him long for the homey, calorie-laden canteen offerings of his housekeeper Mrs. Hooser, a sure sign that something in his universe had gone badly awry.<br>He&#x2019;d had a further bad experience in London that made him eager to return to the shelter of his village. He&#x2019;d seen&#x2014;he could swear he&#x2019;d seen&#x2014;a man in the street who had been involved in the death of his MI5 colleague, Paul. At any rate, it was a man of roughly the same physical type, wearing the same weird blue sunglasses with white frames, that Max had seen hovering near the crime scene that day. He couldn&#x2019;t be certain&#x2014;indeed, couldn&#x2019;t be certain the man he&#x2019;d seen the day of Paul&#x2019;s death was involved in the killing. But Max had been sure enough that he&#x2019;d spun around in the push and shove of pedestrians to follow the man, thinking as he hustled after him that his clerical collar offered the perfect cover for tailing a suspect. He followed him for many blocks, thinking how well he&#x2019;d retained his training from those old days. And then, somewhere a few streets away from Pall Mall, he lost him. He looked frantically left, right, and even overhead. And then he&#x2019;d pounded his fist against a wall, scraping his knuckles in his rage.<br>He called the sighting in directly to his old boss at MI5, dialing his private line, and ended up having dinner with George Greenhouse that evening. It was a bittersweet occasion&#x2014;Max had always held the man in esteem, but he knew how disappointed George had been by Max&#x2019;s decision to leave the life behind for the priesthood.<br>He learned a few things at that dinner in Covent Garden. One was that MI5 had decided someone besides Paul and Max had been injured by the car explosion that killed Paul. For the man with those strange glasses Max had described to investigators had been recorded on one of the ubiquitous London security cameras shortly after the explosion, and he was holding his arm as if injured.<br>&#x201c;But he didn&#x2019;t go to any hospital in London despite his injuries and that&#x2019;s further evidence it&#x2019;s him,&#x201d; George told Max. Whether he was supposed to share this information was doubtful, but then George hadn&#x2019;t gotten where he was by being a company man. Nerveless, famous for his bravery, he also had more integrity than practically anyone Max had ever met.<br>Midway through the main course George had stunned him by saying, &#x201c;She&#x2019;s remarried, you know. Sheila. She got married again recently.&#x201d;<br>Sheila&#x2014;Paul&#x2019;s wife. Max had barely known her, hadn&#x2019;t seen her since the funeral, which she&#x2019;d attended, against all advice, clutching their young son, hers and Paul&#x2019;s&#x2014;grimly holding the blue-swaddled bundle to her. She&#x2019;d stumbled through the service looking as numb as Max had felt.<br>Max was brokenhearted by the news of her remarriage but struggled to hide it from George. What had he expected, though? That Sheila would go into some form of purdah forever? Life had gone on. But something about this permanent move on Sheila&#x2019;s part made him realize how much he himself had stayed in the past of that terrible day.<br>He wondered&#x2014;idle, stupid thought&#x2014;why he hadn&#x2019;t been invited to the wedding. And realized that in some completely mad, irrational way, this bothered him, even though he barely had known Sheila, and his presence at her marriage would have been downright odd. Then he hoped&#x2014;to heaven&#x2014;that it wasn&#x2019;t because she blamed him, Max. For Max blamed himself, and a world of invitations wouldn&#x2019;t change that. Paul wouldn&#x2019;t have been the one killed that day if he hadn&#x2019;t switched places on the job with Max.<br>Paul&#x2019;s death had changed Max&#x2019;s course in life completely, for it was not long afterward that he began training for the priesthood. It wasn&#x2019;t as if he believed&#x2014;not really <i>believed</i>&#x2014;that his life that day in London had been spared by Divine Providence. He refused to see Paul as some placeholder for himself, simply unluckier than he. They had exchanged schedules, he and Paul, as they often h...</p><h2>The Ancient Egyptian Books of the Afterlife</h2><p><p>Ancient Egyptians held a rich and complex vision of the afterlife and codified their beliefs in books that were to be discovered more than two millennia later in royal tombs. Erik Hornung, the world's leading authority on these religious texts, surveys what is known about them today.</p><p>The contents of the texts range from the collection of spells in the Book of the Dead, which was intended to offer practical assistance on the journey to the afterlife, to the detailed accounts of the hereafter provided in the Books of the Netherworld. Hornung looks closely at these latter works, while summarizing the contents of the Book of the Dead and other widely studied examples of the genre. For each composition, he discusses the history of its ancient transmission and its decipherment in modern times, supplying bibliographic information for any text editions. He also seeks to determine whether this literature as a whole presents a monolithic conception of the afterlife. The volume features many drawings from the books themselves&#x2015;drawings that illustrate the nocturnal course of the sun god through the realm of the dead.</p><p>Originally published in German and now available in a fluid English translation, this volume offers an accessible and enlightening introduction to a central element of ancient Egyptian religion.</p></p><p><p>Erik Hornung is Professor Emeritus of Egyptology at the University of Basel.

As they become part of fashionable London society they encounter the glamorous socialite Rosamund Harwell and her wealthy impressario husband Laurence. Unlike the Wimseys, they are not in love - and all too soon, one of them is dead. A murder case that only Lord Peter Wimsey can solve.</p><p>Asked by her new husband, the gentleman detective Lord Peter Wimsey, why she is having trouble writing her latest mystery novel, Harriet Vane explains, "When I needed the money, it justified itself. It was a job of work, and I did it as well as I could, and that was that. But now, you see, it has no necessity except itself. And, of course, it's hard; it's always been hard, and it's getting harder. So when I'm stuck I think, this isn't my livelihood, and it isn't great art, it's only detective stories. You read them and write them for fun." Is this a clue to the mystery of why Dorothy L. Sayers put aside her 13th full-length Lord Peter novel in 1938 and never finished it? She had made lots of money, and was much more interested in translating Dante and writing about religion. Or is it another excellent novelist, Jill Paton Walsh, speculating--in a perfect imitation of Sayers's voice--on what might have happened? Walsh was invited by the estate of Sayers's illegitimate son, Anthony Fleming, to finish <i>Thrones, Dominations</i>. She has done a splendid job, certain to please Sayers loyalists on the "dorothyl" listserv as well as those new to the Wimsey canon. Lord Peter has been made much more human and interesting by marriage; Harriet is a wise and acerbic companion; and the story, about the murders of two beautiful young women involved with a theatrical producer, is full of twists and connivance. There's also a fascinating subplot involving the soon-to-abdicate King Edward VII and a country on the brink of World War II. Earlier Wimseys in paperback include <i>The Five Red Herrings</i>, <i>Gaudy Night</i>, <i>Murder Must Advertise</i>, and <i>Unnatural Death</i>. Books in print by Walsh include a mystery called <i>A Piece of Justice</i> and a novel, <i>The Serpentine Cave</i>.Praise for <i>Thrones, Dominations</i>:<p> "Engrossing, intelligent, and provocative." --<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p> "Extraordinary...it is impossible to tell where Dorothy L. Sayers ends and Jill Paton Walsh begins." --Ruth Rendell, <i>The London Sunday Times</i></p><p> "[Walsh] has done a splendid job-certain to please the legions of Sayers loyalists as well as readers new to the Wimsey canon." --<i>Chicago Tribune</i></p></p><h2>Introducing Walter Benjamin: A Graphic Guide</h2><p><p>This beautifully illustrated guide to Walter Benjamin&#x2014;the genius behind the famous essay <i>The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction</i>&#x2014;traces his influence on modern aesthetics and cultural history as well as his particular focus on the tension between Marxism and Zionism, and between word and image in modern art.</p></p><p>Howard Caygill is Professor Of Modern European Philosophy at Kingston University, London.

All the stats, the facts, the stories, and the (often unheralded) glory.</p><p><em>The Baseball Talmud</em> reveals that there is far more to Jewish baseball than Hank Greenberg's powerful slugging and Sandy Koufax's masterful control. From Ausmus to Zinn, Berg to Kinsler, Holtzman to Yeager, and many others, Megdal draws upon the lore and the little-known details that increase our enjoyment of the game, including:</p><ul><p></p><li>Which Jewish player spent a portion of his retirement as a spy</li><p></p><p></p><li>Who received $50,000 and a car to quit school and join the Major Leagues</li><p></p><p></p><li>How many players sat out of games scheduled on Yom Kippur</li><p></p><p></p><li>Which famous player chose baseball over becoming a rabbi</li><p></p></ul><p>But this is more than just stories.

Back in his day, baseball, like most of America, was segregated. Major League Baseball was for whites only. Black and brown-skinned players had to play in the Negro Leagues. They were denied entry into the major leagues just because of the color of their skin. Finding food worth eating or a restaurant to serve them was a daily problem. Branch Rickey asked him to play for the Brooklyn Dodgers? That first spring was tough. Some fans cheered him and others shouted insults but he was the man that broke the color barrier in baseball.</p><p></p><h2>Grooks 5</h2><p>From the publisher: &#34;What in the world is a Grook? A grook is a short, aphoristic poem, accompanied by an appropriate drawing, revealing in a minimum of words and with a minimum of lines some basic truth about the human condition. Grooks were created originally during the Nazi occupation of Denmark. They began life as a sort of underground language just out of reach of the understanding of the Germans. They have since become one of the most widely read forms of composition in the Scandinavian - and English - languages. Grooks are the product of one of the most ingenious minds of this or any other century. A Danish scientist turned poet, Piet Hein has published longer poems, fiction, drama and essays; he has designed a &#39;rectangular oval&#39;, the Super-Ellipse, used in the new Stockholm city center and other cities; he has invented games, the newest of which, SOMA and the Super-Egg, have just been released by Parker Brothers to the delight of hundreds of thousands. What in the world is a grook? Look inside and see for yourself; but beware: you are about to become a grookaddict, a happy victim of one of the most relaxing pleasures available in this nervous world....&#34; The first Grooks book was originally published in the US by M.I.T. Press in 1966.</p><p></p><h2>The Grand Illusion: Love, Lies, and My Life with Styx</h2><p>They are still one of the biggest rock bands of the last three decades. With four consecutive triple-platinum albums and 54 million records sold, their tours continue to sell out and classic songs like "Lady," "Renegade," "Come Sail Away," and "The Grand Illusion" have earned them a whole new generation of fans. At the height of their fame, they were living the ultimate rock &#x2018;n&#x2019; roll fantasy -- an odyssey of groupies, drugs, and music that most musicians only dream of. As a band, Styx seemed invincible. But their founding member and bass player, Chuck Panozzo, was about to hit rock bottom. His seemingly debauched life as the ultimate rocker was a lie -- and the truth was about to catch up with him. <p><i>The Grand Illusion</i> is a no-holds-barred, backstage pass to the journey of one of the world&#x2019;s most revered bands, and the true story of Chuck Panozzo&#x2019;s 50-year struggle to reconcile his public life as a rock star with his private life as a gay man. Beginning with the birth of Styx in Chicago and their meteoric rise, <i>The Grand Illusion</i> is a revealing look at the triumphs and tragedies that surrounded Panozzo&#x2019;s life. He chronicles life on the road, the break-up of the band, his struggle to help his twin brother and bandmate John Panozzo battle addiction, as well as his split with Dennis De Young, and finally coming to terms with his HIV positive status. Illuminating and unflinching, <i>The Grand Illusion</i> will captivate the band&#x2019;s legions of devoted fans, as well as music lovers everywhere.</p></p><p><p> <b>Chuck Panozzo</b> (Chicago, IL) is the bass player for and a founding member of Styx. Since 2001, Panozzo has been involved in campaigning for AIDS awareness and gay rights. <b>Michele Skettino </b>(New York, NY) is a professional writer. She has worked in the music and entertainment industry since 1989. </p>Panozzo was the bass player in Styx, whose mid-'70s hits such as "Mr. Roboto," and "Lady" are staples of classic rock radio, and he is rightfully proud of Styx's accomplishments&#x2014;"The first rock band ever to sell four consecutive triple platinum albums." Styx's fans will enjoy Panozzo's detailed look at the band's internal conflicts as they rise from small Chicago bars to sold-out arenas. But the heart of Panozzo's autobiography is a sensitive and insightful look at "one gay man's struggle to come to terms with himself" while performing in a rock world where "the things that would make the other guys laugh&#x2014;a female fan lifting up her skirt, a pair of panties thrown on stage&#x2014;just didn't do it" for him. The most fascinating sections are accounts of Panozzo's conflicted youthful feelings in his sheltered Catholic neighborhood; his adolescent trips to gay theaters where "skin flicks validated the fact that there were other people out there like me"; his attempts to keep his rock identity secret during furtive dates while on tour where he "treated every excursion like a CIA mission;" and a joyous moment when he publicly comes out and decides to tell his story "to inspire others, gay or straight, to live a proud, truthful life." <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It is available as a fresh squeezed juice, a dehydrated powder, or tablets. This book uses the name "wheat" grass because it is the most popular, but the common grains of barley, oat and rye grow grasses that are equally potent. See Spiritual &amp; Religious Roots, History &amp; Culture, Healing with Grass, Nutrition, The Pioneers, Real Stories from Real People. </p><p>What does it do? <br>It has broad effectiveness, but its three most therapeutic roles are: blood purification, liver detoxification, and colon cleansing. As a food it is very nourishing and restorative with such a complete range nutrients that it can, by itself, sustain life. This nutritional miracle is most evident in the animal kingdom where studies prove large and small grazing animals not only sustain themselves on young grasses but also improve their health. See Healing with Grass, Nutrition, Research, Real Stories from Real People, Spiritual &amp; Religious Roots. </p><p>How do I take it? <br>Therapeutically, you would drink the fresh juice or apply it rectally through enemas or implants. For nutrition and prevention, you can make powdered drinks or take tablets. See The Juicers, Healing with Grass, Real Stories from Real People. </p><p>Where do I get it? <br>From your natural food store, juice bar, direct from growers, or mail order. See Resources, The Companies, The Pioneers, Healing Resorts. </p><p>Why should I take it? <br>Wheatgrass earned its reputation from people with terminal illnesses who took it at the eleventh hour of their lives, after conventional medicine left them with no hope. But you can take it as part of a long range prevention and health maintenance program. See Healing with Grass, Research, Nutrition, Real Stories from Real People. </p><p>How do I get started? <br>You can grow the grass yourself, buy it from a grower or health food store, drink the juice at a juice bar or buy bottled grass tablets and powders. But if you are sick, it is highly recommended that you enroll in a retreat center for a 24 week wellness program. As an alternative, you can establish a home-health program using the information in this book and the guidance of a knowledgeable health professional. See Grow Your Own Grass, The Juicers, The Companies, Healing Resorts. </p><p>Why should I believe you? <br>There are many scientific studies demonstrating the efficacy and nutrition of grass foods. Most information about its therapeutic effectiveness is based on clinical evidence and the word-of-mouth testimony of users. See Science &amp; Wheatgrass, Research, Real Stories from Real People, Nutrition, Spiritual &amp; Religious Roots, History &amp; Culture. </p><p>Wheat Grass vs. Wheatgrass <br>A word on spelling. "Wheat grass" is a variety of grass like barley, oats and rye, grown in fields across America. "Wheatgrass" refers to grass grown indoors in trays for approximately 10 days and is the kind that is squeezed into a fresh juice. The tray-grown grass is used primarily for therapeutic purposes. The 60+day old field grown grasses, available in dehydrated powder or tablets, are used primarily as nutritional supplements.</p>Wheatgrass Nature's Finest Medicine <p>The Complete Guide to Using Grass Foods &amp; Juices to Help Your Health </p><p>Cleanse....

Adjoining the text, providing an illustrated history of their own, is a large selection of complete comic book stories. No selected snippets. Full stories. &#34;It seems safe to say,&#34; the authors write, &#34;that no book to date has contained such a wide range of comic book tales Where else can one find in the same volume such divergent personalities as the Old Witch and Donald Duck, or Captain America and Those Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers?&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Titanic Survivor</h2><p>Violet Jessop's life is an inspiring story of survival. Born in 1887 in Argentina, the eldest child of Irish immigrants, at the age of 21 she became the breadwinner for her widowed mother and five siblings when she commenced a career as a stewardess and nurse on some of the most famous ocean going vessels of the day. Throughout her 40 year time at sea she survived an unbelievable series of events including the sinking of the TITANIC. <br><br>&#x201c;One awful moment of empty, misty blackness enveloped us in its loneliness, then an unforgettable, agonizing cry went up from 1500 despairing throats, a long wail and then silence and our tiny craft tossing about at the mercy of the ice field.&#x201d; <br>For most people one sinking would be enough. But four years later Violet, now a nurse with the British Red Cross, was on board the World War I hospital ship BRITANNIC when it struck a mine and sank to the bottom of the Aegean. To her, this disaster was even more horrifying-- &#x201c;Just as life seeming nothing but a whirling, choking ache, I rose to the light of day, my nose barely above the little lapping waves. I opened my eyes on an indescribable scene of slaughter, which made me shut them again to keep it out." <br><br>By the end of her story we have a met a woman who could handle whatever life threw at her with determination and good humor. She knew that only by her own strength of character would she survive. But Titanic Survivor is much more. A unique autobiography for those who want to know how it really felt, a story that could be told only by a Titanic Survivor.</p><p>Violet Jessop (1887-1971) was a maritime stewardess and nurse who survived the sinking of both the Titanic and Britannic. She worked aboard ships into her sixties, traveling all over the world. After her last voyage, she lived the rest of her life in Suffolk, England.<br>Aside from the disasters, there is much in her memoirs to enjoy; from her tales of travel, to the ships themselves, and to the many characters she met in a fascinating lifetime at sea.

However, with an increasing number of theologians, church leaders, and even popular Christian books and magazines questioning this doctrine, which naysayers have described as a form of "cosmic child abuse," a fresh articulation and affirmation of penal substitution is needed. And Jeffery, Ovey, and Sach have responded here with clear exposition and analysis.</p> <p>They make the case not only that the doctrine is clearly taught in Scripture, but that it has an impeccable pedigree and a central place in Christian theology, and that its neglect has serious consequences. The authors also systematically analyze over twenty specific objections that have been brought against penal substitution and charitably but firmly offer a defining declaration of the doctrine of the cross for any concerned reader.</p></p><p><p><strong>Steve Jeffery</strong> is a minister&nbsp;at Emmanuel Evangelical Church in Southgate, London.

Leaving behind their hometowns and most constraints of the post-Victorian era, the &#34;good time girls&#34; crossed both geographic and social frontiers, finding freedom, independence, hardship, heartbreak, adn sometimes astonishing wealth. These women posessed teh courage and perseverance to brave a dangerous journey of more than a thousand miles, into a harsh wilderness where men sometimes outnumbered them more than ten to one. Many of these women later became successful entrepreneurs, wealthy property owners, or the wives of prominent citizens; one former prostitute married the mayor of Fairbanks and hosted a visit from President Warren G.

Whether comparing the history of the Jews of the West with the Jewish experience in the older regions of the country or bringing attention to<br>the uniquely local aspects of the western experience, the contributors to this landmark volume perceive the West as an increasingly important and vital presence in the nation's history. The agrarians of Utah's Clarion and<br>the cureseekers of Denver, no less than the boomers of Tucson, have been representative Americans, Jews, and westerners. Essays on the role of intermarriage, the shared encounter of immigrants and migrants, and the response to the founding of the State of Israel by western pioneer families, tell us much about the interaction of the West with our American world nation.</p></p><p>New perspectives on our understanding of the West, its Jews, and other Americans, both old and new.<p>Moses Rischin, professor of history at San Francisco State University, received his Ph.D. from Harvard University.

With pastoral wisdom and passion, Dr.&nbsp;Lutzer explores the remarkable story of the Reformation, and he powerfully demonstrates why the story of the Reformation is, in fact, our story.

Lutzer and his wife, Rebecca, live in the Chicago area.<b>A riveting account of the Reformation--and why it matters today<br></b><br>The Reformation unfolded in the cathedrals and town squares of Europe--in Wittenberg, Worms, Rome, Geneva, and Zurich. The story begins with the Catholic Church and its desperate need for reform. The dramatic events that followed are traced from John Wycliffe in England, to the burning of John Hus at the stake at the Council of Constance, to the rampant sale of indulgences in the cities and towns of Germany, to Martin Luther nailing the <i>Ninety-Five Theses</i> to the door of the Castle Church in 1517, to John Calvin's reform of Geneva. <br><br>In prose that captivates as it informs, Erwin W. Lutzer captures the people, places, and big ideas that fueled the Reformation. He explains its lasting influence on the church and Western civilization. And, perhaps most importantly, he shows why the actions of passionate believers five hundred years ago still matter today.<br>"At the Reformation's five hundredth anniversary, Erwin Lutzer reminds us not only why the Reformation is one of the most significant events in Western history but also why it still holds important lessons for the church today. As Lutzer demonstrates in this book, the theological convictions of Luther, Zwingli, and Calvin need to be recovered as an antidote to the watered-down gospel proclaimed from many Protestant pulpits in our day. Every Protestant needs to recognize the incredible theological debt we owe to the Reformers. Let this book introduce you to their lives, their ministries, and, most importantly, their theology."--<b>R. Albert Mohler Jr.</b>, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary</p>
